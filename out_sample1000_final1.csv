Temperatures soared to 17C in Brighton and Dorset, with people starting their long weekend in deck chairs by the sea. Figures from Asda suggest the unexpected sunshine has also inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages and equipment expected to triple those in April. Sun's out: Brighton beach was packed with Britons enjoying the unexpected sunshine to start the long weekend as temperatures hit 17C across the south coast . Although frost is set to hit the south tonight - with temperatures dropping to 1C - Britons stocking up for a barbecue will be in luck tomorrow, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny weather across southern England, southern Wales and the south Midlands. In Weymouth, Dorset, the sun came out in time for the town's annual kite festival, held on the beach. But the good weather has not been enjoyed by all as heavy rain poured down across the north west. Unfortunately, the dark clouds and intermittent rain across northern England and Scotland is set to last throughout the long weekend and into Tuesday. However, the north east enjoyed a bright spell at midday today with sun shining in Harrogate and York ahead of the rainy weekend. Met Office spokesman Helen Roberts told MailOnline: 'It hasn't been great for the whole country - it's been a story of two halves.

e80e130d55bf30e5a0f547aaaa4cd9930635bfbd,"(CNN) -- Place a tennis ball into a yellow sock and tuck it into the back of your pants. Now start running. Congratulations! You are a snitch. Don't get caught, or the game ends. This is quidditch, as played by muggles. In JK Rowling's novels, the snitch is a sort-of magical, winged squash ball, pursued by ""seeker"" Harry Potter in a variety of high-stakes, airborne quidditch contests. Nobody on the UCLA campus has a magical, winged squash ball. A man with a tennis ball dangling from his shorts will have to do. ""The snitch is the surrealist aspect of the game,"" concedes Sebastian Milla, former UCLA quidditch player and star of a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his sport. Mudbloods -- a title taken from the novels' derogatory term for wizards with non-magical parents -- explores the result when you take a fictional sport and make it real. In 2005, eight years after the publication of the first Potter book, Vermont's Middlebury College gave birth to ""muggle quidditch,"" which translates Rowling's imaginary sport into our world. Nobody can fly, but a broom between the legs remains mandatory. Three circular goals are used at each end of the field, as per the books. Ten points are scored for getting the ""quaffle"" (a volleyball) through those hoops, and 30 for catching the snitch. Where magical ""bludgers"" are unavailable, they are replaced by dodgeballs thrown at rival players. Finally, and unusually, both magical and muggle quidditch are mixed-gender, full-contact sports. Becoming real . The intrigue for many viewers of Mudbloods will be seeing how this sport works, and discovering who wants to play a sport so closely associated with the world of fantasy fiction.

When Newsnight's Emily Maitlis asked me during a debate on the programme this week whether I was a feminist, I hoped my blow-dried hair and figure-hugging dress would give her some clue as to the answer. Feeling a little mischievous, I was tempted to ask her whether I looked like one of those grumpy women in bad clothes who spend their days in a state of agitation about whether it's right to let girls play with dolls. But since I was a guest on the BBC's flagship news programme, I decided to park the sarcasm and simply say that I am not: that today's feminism is utterly irrelevant to me. I explained to Emily and my fellow panellists, Professor Mary Beard and Natascha McElhone, that feminism has betrayed its roots and deteriorated into spurious artificial engineering. Rather than campaigning to help women, feminists today are more likely to be picking fights on Twitter, or dressing up petty grievances as proof of rampant 'sexism'. And, needless to say, these devotees of 'equality' believe you can't be a feminist unless you're Left-wing. Spoiling for a fight is the default position of today's chippy feminists.

The rap superstar, featured in the song ""Karate Chop"" by Future, says: ""Beat that p---- up like Emmett Till."" Till, a 14-year-old black youth, was killed in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. He was beaten to the extent that his face was unrecognizable when his body was discovered. He was identified by a monogrammed ring belonging to his father. Mountain Dew, a brand of PepsiCo, said Friday its relationship with the rapper would end. A Mountain Dew spokesman told CNN, ""We do not plan any additional work with Lil Wayne moving forward. His offensive reference to a revered civil rights icon does not reflect the values of our brand."" The spokesman declined to comment on the company's previous relationship with the artist. Sarah Cunningham, publicist for Lil Wayne's record label, Young Money, issued the following statement to CNN: ""I can confirm that due to creative differences, we mutually decided to part ways. It was amicable."" Till, a Chicago teenager who was visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955, was arrested at gunpoint and severely beaten. One of his eyes was gouged before he was killed by a single gunshot to the head. The teen's body was tied to a large fan before being dumped into a river. Members of the Till family could not be reached for comment Friday by CNN, but the Rev. Al Sharpton said he has set up a meeting next week between PepsiCo officials and members of the family.

Focusing on sporting success is a waste of time because 'very, very few children' are going to make it, an academic has said. Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, says there is little proof that the Olympic Games create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy. And he believes it is high time parents realised children are more likely to make the finals of shows like The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent than become sporting heroes of any sort.

'We shouldn’t be trying to channel all of our energy into this pursuit of excellence in sports when very, very few children are going to succeed at any kind of level at all,' he said. 'My answer to parents who tell me their child might become a leading footballer or athlete is that they are putting them at risk of serious injury or closer to the world of performance-enhancing drugs. 'I ask them: ""Are you happy about that?"" and they say: ""It won’t happen to my child"". 'To which I reply: ""But it goes with the territory"". The cheats are very often those at the top.

'Do we want to churn out one-dimensional characters who leave no stone unturned in pursuit of excellence?'

Children's play is under threat from adults who ‘over-supervise’ and ‘over-schedule’, a report says. It says youngsters cannot develop normally and are ‘play deprived’ because of our risk-averse, regimented lifestyles. This means many lack vital skills such as resourcefulness, independence or self-regulation. The research, discussed on EU ‘play day’ at the European Parliament yesterday, is the work of Dr David Whitebread, a senior lecturer in psychology of education at Cambridge University. He consulted researchers from across Europe and found children’s leisure time is cut down by too much school work, safety fears, and lack of understanding of the impact of free play. His report, The Importance of Play, warns ‘play provision is under threat in Europe’ and adult intervention is often ‘counter-productive’. It says the UK in particular is ‘quite risk-averse’, with children ‘heavily supervised’ and forced to play indoors or in a garden or specially designed soft play area. This compares with the more rural Scandinavian countries where children play independently in natural surroundings. Just a generation ago, British children did the same, it adds. Children have ‘increasingly limited opportunities for the free play and association with their peers which were so commonly available . . . to their parents and grandparents,’ the report says.

Pte Huggins, 23, from the Hertfordshire regiment's D Company, was on sentry duty at a forward listening post just 20 yards from the enemy when he was killed with a single bullet to the head. The shooting enraged his platoon Sergeant Gregory, who demanded he take his place and immediately set about scanning the frost-covered ground before taking the sniper out with a shot. Then as the experienced soldier continued scouring enemy lines he spotted another sniper - but the German marksmen had seen Sgt Gregory, 36, first and in a split-section action shot him dead.

Eight valuable 'vettes at Bowling Green, Kentucky's National Corvette Museum fell victim to a 40-foot-wide, 20-foot-deep sinkhole that opened up in the facility's yellow Sky Dome wing. The museum unofficially estimates it caused millions of dollars in damage. Motion detectors alerted security that something was amiss shortly after 5:30 a.m., said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. An employee who first walked into the room ""has been in shock all day,"" she said. ""When you go in there, it's unreal,"" said Frassinelli. ""The hole is so big, it makes the Corvettes look like little Matchbox cars."" The news triggered a collective worldwide gasp from the Corvette Nation. ""I was shocked,"" said Frazer Bharucha, 47, a Corvette owner since age 17. ""We're talking about iconic cars that have been around for years."" Using remote-controlled drones, geologists and engineers from nearby Western Kentucky University have already explored the sinkhole and determined that the Sky Dome suffered no structural damage, Frassinelli said. ""There's a cave down there,"" she said, adding that the museum is only a short drive away from Mammoth Cave National Park.

2221bf980d57b4a3c54509c585a9afbcfbeb49e6,"German authorities have asked pop star Justin Bieber to hand over nearly $8,000 for the costs of caring for the capuchin monkey he left behind in Munich after bringing it on tour without the right paperwork. The bill covers the cost of vaccinations, accommodation and transport for the monkey, known as Mally, which is now being cared for at a zoo in northern Germany. Customs officials posted a public notice of the bill after failing to get a response from Bieber at the address he gave to customs officials, said Martin Brandlhuber, a customs spokesman at Munich's airport. In light of that, German authorities have followed the applicable laws and made the claim publicly known, he said. Bieber must pay up the next time he comes to Germany or risk being denied entry, Brandlhuber said. If he is unable to pay cash, then customs officials could confiscate other property to meet the claim, Brandlhuber said. Alternatively, Bieber could be denied entry and be required to provide a valid address. The young monkey was taken to a Munich animal shelter after it was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on a European tour. Mally was transferred to the Serengeti Park in Hodenhagen, near Hanover, in June after spending several weeks in quarantine. Bieber had until May 7 to present the paperwork to reclaim his pet but failed to do so, zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel said last month. As a result, Mally is now the property of the German government, and the Serengeti Park is acting as the caretaker. The park was picked because it is the only zoo in Germany that has a family of capuchins for Mally to join. Bieber's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated.

I was so pleased that  Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of Prince Edward  and the Countess of Wessex, appears to have had what  was a fairly dramatic squint corrected. With conditions like this, some people have a tendency to make unfair assumptions about someone’s character based purely on appearance. The family have chosen not  to reveal the details of ten-year-old Lady Louise’s treatment, and whether she had surgery  is not known. Before and after: Lady Louise Windsor in June 2013, left, and right, attenidng the Christmas Meeting at Ascot Racecourse in December after her correction . Although there are many options for treating a squint,  an operation shouldn’t be shied away from – it’s not simply a cosmetic treatment, but one that saves sight. Can’t some people with  a squint see just fine? People can learn to live with varying degrees of vision  and sight loss. But this condition, if untreated, usually leads to deterioration in the capabilities  of the affected eye, which is why treatment at a young age is recommended. A squint – the medical term is strabismus – is when the eyes do not align in their movements. One eye will look straight ahead, while the other turns inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards. As the eyes are focusing on different things, the brain ignores the signals from one eye to avoid ‘seeing double’. It’s this eye that becomes  weak, and eventually vision in it starts to worsen. The problem is often  something a child is born with, evident from birth, and it is due  to weaknesses in the muscles that surround the eye. A child is more at risk of a squint if they are born prematurely, like Lady Louise, or have a family history  of them. Saving grace: The squint, also known as a lazy eye, prevented Lady Louise, pictured before her operation with her mother Sophie Countess of Wessex, from seeing straight . Is surgery the only sure way of correcting it? No, it’s usually offered only once other options have proved ineffective","Lady Louise Windsor, daughter of Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex, appears to have had a dramatic squint corrected.

Schaefer was serving a 20-year sentence at the national penitentiary in Santiago for sexually abusing children at the notorious commune known as Colonia Dignidad (The Dignity Colony). The commune in southern Chile, also called Villa Baviera, was created as a place to safeguard Germanic traditions. Under Schaefer's rule, contact with outsiders was largely forbidden. Some of Schaefer's crimes date to the 1970s and 1980s, during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who had visited the commune. Former members of the colony have admitted that human rights violations and sexual abuse of children occurred there, saying in a 2006 letter published in a leading Chilean newspaper that they were led by Schaefer's influence. Schaefer had been in prison since 2006 when he was extradited to Chile from Argentina, where he had been living in hiding. Schaefer died Saturday morning of cardiopulmonary arrest, the penitentiary said.

She got it in eight hours -- and nearly $8 million more after that. ""It was the opposite of 'Field of Dreams,' "" said Uhrman, a gaming-industry veteran and former vice president at IGN. ""It was, if you come, we will build this."" And so was born Ouya, a $99 console that's shaped like and is just a hair bigger than a Rubik's Cube. It runs on Google's Android operating system and requires developers to offer a version of their games for free. Kickstarter backers will be getting their Ouyas later this month and they'll go on sale to everyone else in June. Speaking here at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, Uhrman said she got the idea for Ouya (pronounced OOO-yuh) in response to a video-game industry that to her had grown stale. No new consoles were announced at last year's E3 gaming conference by the big three console makers (Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony). In recent years, almost all the most hyped and popular games have been sequels. And the rise of mobile gaming has been limited, turning video gaming into a solitary exercise rather than the social one she remembered growing up. ""The TV is the best screen for playing games,"" Uhrman said in an interview-style keynote with editor Joshua Topolsky of tech blog The Verge. ""I remember growing up, playing with my sister ... I feel like we've lost that. I want to bring back the world of TV gaming."" For gamers, the strength of a console often boils down to the games they can play on it. To that end, Uhrman said 7,000 developers have signed up for Ouya accounts, from big publishers who create multi-million-selling titles like ""Halo"" down to the smaller independents. The only requirement, she says, is that the game must be free or offer a free trial before the player has to buy it.

At 1:49 pm ET on Friday, the Central Intelligence Agency sent its first-ever Twitter message, from a verified account with the simple handle of @CIA. With characteristic secrecy, it said: ""We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet."" The Internet immediately erupted with delight. Within two hours the message had been retweeted more than 85,000 times, the CIA had gained more than 105,000 followers, and the jokes were flowing faster than Claire Danes' tears on ""Homeland."" ""@CIA how does it feel to be followed for once?"" replied one Twitter user. Social media outreach does seem like an odd fit for a shadowy spy agency whose work is mostly classified. But the CIA, which also joined Facebook on Friday, is trying to brighten its public face. ""By expanding to these platforms, CIA will be able to more directly engage with the public and provide information on CIA's mission, history, and other developments,"" said CIA Director John Brennan in a statement. ""We have important insights to share, and we want to make sure that unclassified information about the Agency is more accessible to the American public that we serve, consistent with our national security mission."" The agency also promised to post ""the latest news, statements, and career information"" from the CIA, along with artifacts from the CIA's museum, updates from its World Factbook and unclassified intelligence information.

Children exposed to high levels of pollution in the womb are at greater risk of suffering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has found. Scientists at Columbia University studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in New York. They found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy were five times more likely to have ADHD by the time they were nine years old. The nine-year study looked at levels of common pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Researchers measured the levels of PAH in maternal and umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery. And they repeated tests when each of the children were three and five, measuring levels of PAH in their urine. Thirty-three children who had high levels of exposure to PAHs, as measured at birth. Of those, 13 were diagnosed with ADHD hyperactive-impulsive subtype, seven the inattentive subtype, and 13 had both. Professor Frederica Perera, first author of the study, said: 'Those children born to moms who were exposed to high levels of PAH during pregnancy had five times the odds of having an increased number of symptoms.' PAHs are created when products like coal, oil, gas and rubbish are burned but not completely. They don't burn easily, and as a result remain in the environment for long periods of time. Most are used to conduct research though some are used to make dyes, plastics and pesticides. One of the most common ways they enter the body is through breathing in contaminated air. To establish children's exposure to PAHs in the womb, the scientists measured levels of fragments of the mothers' DNA bonded to PAH molecules, also known as DNA adducts, in umbilical cord blood. Previous studies carried out by Professor Perera and her team identified links between higher levels of prenatal PAH exposure and developmental delays in chil",Scientists at Columbia University studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in New York.

Twenty years ago, a friend and I were visiting the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati and saw an exhibit of African-American quilts. I'll never forget one particular piece by the artist Faith Ringgold -- a family sitting at a Thanksgiving table, with their thoughts sewn into the fabric. I just knew right away: I wanted to tell stories with cotton. It's exciting to start on a quilt. I tape paper to my wall and sketch patterns and notes. Going to the fabric store for the right colors or prints feels as important as the actual sewing. And then I clear out a huge empty space in my family room, and I get busy. I don't know how to draw, so it amazes me that this magical, creative part of me comes out. Here's an example: A few years ago, when I was yearning for a date on a Friday night, I asked myself, ""How can I capture this feeling in fabric?"" So I made a quilt that reads ""SBF praying for a SBM to share my quilt."" The image is of a black woman, and if you look really closely, the background pattern is filled with couples. I love layering the story like that. I probably couldn't make a living quilting, and I'm glad of that. My 9-to-5 job as a product manager means I don't have to make quilts to sell.

f9fbf94a03221f3d1cc5d8e53e8d1395d4b59aea,"Tuwaitha, Iraq (CNN) -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River, but its radioactive legacy lingers on. The Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein. Now, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work. ""It is difficult because of the destruction,"" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. ""This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities."" Workers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades. ""We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,"" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. ""We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take."" Iraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility. Despite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004.

In 2004, a monstrous black wave of rubble surged towards Rinaldi as he ran for his life. In October, the trauma of that day was relived as he took part in a drill to test the area's new tsunami early warning system. Five years ago, Rinaldi had no shelter to run to as giant waves crashed onto Indonesia's west coast, but things have changed since the tsunami left some 245,000 dead or missing in 14 countries across the Indian Ocean region. Early warning sirens drone, and there are shelters that can hold hundreds of people. Twenty nations took part in the October tsunami drill. The Indian Ocean region now has new deep-water buoys -- or tsunami sensors, sirens, tide gauges and a web of communications systems to help forewarn a future catastrophe. But experts said the new instruments and drills are not enough. Educating communities about how to react to signs of a threat like a tsunami -- with or without an official warning -- is what they see as a key challenge.

Christians in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday protest the slayings of seven Christians in weekend violence. Rana Sana Ullah, Punjab's provincial law minister, told CNN that the paramilitary Rangers force was helping police and maintaining law and order. Seven people were killed and 20 injured Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, authorities said. Police said the Muslims were protesting an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran, the Muslim sacred text, at a Christian wedding. At a news conference in Islamabad carried on local TV, Shehbaz Bhatti, federal minister for minorities, said an investigation determined there was no desecration of the Quran in village 95 Gill near Gojra City, and the allegations were baseless. He also said the government will rebuild all the burned houses. Bhatti told CNN that four women, two men and a child, all Christians, were either shot to death or killed when their houses were burned. About 50 houses were burned down, and more than 100 were looted by the protesters, Bhatti said. The incident occurred in Gojra City, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore. Kamran Michael, Punjab provincial minister for human rights and minority affairs, who is a Christian, told CNN after meeting with Pakistan's Christian leaders in Gojra that a consensus had been reached to observe three days of mourning, from Monday to Wednesday, for the attack on the Christians. On those three days, all schools, colleges, missions and educational institutions run by Christians will remain closed. Christian schools in Karachi, which were due to open for the new term Monday, remained closed. However, schools in most other areas of Pakistan are still on summer vacation.

A film portraying Nick Clegg’s role in the creation of the first Coalition government since the Second World War has been announced – sparking ridicule in Westminster. The one-off Channel 4 programme – quickly dubbed ‘Nick Clegg the movie’ – will be set in the days following the 2010 election when backroom deals helped shut Labour out of power for the first time since 1997. The revelation sparked speculation in Westminster over which Hollywood actor would play Mr Clegg - a former university Thespian himself – and his glamorous Spanish wife Miriam. Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - pictured at the Merlin Theatre, Nether Edge, in 2006 - took a leading role in the panto Sleeping Beauty, playing the Prince. He is seen with Rivka Smith who plays Sleeping Beauty . A Lib Dem source close to the Deputy Prime Minister suggested there was already one superstar in the running. The source said: ‘That would explain why Johnny Depp has been calling.’ The Spanish actress Penelope Cruz was also suggested as a leading contender to play Miriam. But Mr Clegg may fancy a go playing himself in the movie. He once played the prince in an amateur pantomime of Sleeping Beauty at university. Mr Clegg has previously boasted about his days as a wannabe actor. He said: 'Acting was a great love of mine and I never would have caught the idea of drama unless I'd been encouraged to do so in school.' Speaking to the acting magazine The Stage he added: 'When I was younger, I had the privilege of performing alongside others who have since gone on to lead very successful acting careers.'

Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. ""There are a 182 potential claimants out there,"" Winkler said. ""There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases."" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. ""I look forward to signing this legislation into law,"" Pawlenty said in a statement.

In his filing last May for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which he sought to have his assets liquidated and his debts discharged, Jason S. Rodriguez listed his assets at $4,675 and his liabilities at $89,873.31. His 2002 Nissan XTerra with 110,000 miles represented $4,000 of those assets. His personal property filing described the vehicle as having body damage on the right side, an air conditioner that did not work and a transmission that was slipping. He said his monthly income as a ""sandwich artist"" at a Subway Restaurant in Orlando, where he had worked for nine months, was $890.67, and he listed his monthly expenses at $815. A man who answered the phone at the restaurant referred a caller to company headquarters, where spokesman Kevin Kane confirmed that Rodriguez had worked for the company, but left six weeks ago. Kane said the company has a job title of ""sandwich artist."" Before leaving Subway, Rodriguez's income had already taken a hit, dropping from $27,686 in 2007 to $13,936 in 2008. Rodriguez estimated the value of his household goods -- a TV, microwave, bed, computer, dresser, two night stands, etc. -- at $500 and said his girlfriend owned the remaining household goods. He faced an $11,085 claim of child support. In addition, he was behind on his rent ($1,402.05), owed $450 to American Express, $110 to AT&T for his cell phone service and $343 to Florida Hospital Orlando for unspecified medical services, the document said. Among his creditors were the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid 2005 and 2006 taxes totaling $2,415. The largest debts were for student loans -- $8,500 to Wachovia, $28,912 to Sallie Mae.

Also present at the meeting were Hancy Lescouflair (wife of the Minister of Sports and the Women's League President) and the national head coach Jean Yves Labaze. The meeting was over and I was getting ready to leave when I felt the house shaking. I ran towards the back exit of the house. While going downstairs it was shaking really badly, I lost my balance and fell and blocks of debris fell on my hand. I got up and fell again with a huge amount of debris falling on my body. I was scared but I got up again to move away from the house that I then saw collapse in a white cloud. With the few that were able to escape this tragedy, and also the friends of the football family, we started helping people trapped under the rubble.

Unfortunately, more than 30 perished and even more saddening, we were not able to recover their body for days.

We were helpless, beside three cases, to remove their bodies and return them to their families. What was going through your mind after the earthquake?

b5104416327ccc29f602f6bd1320f9d7c3ce5166,"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal came into the French Open with his air of invincibility punctured by recent defeats but his beaten opponent Thursday -- Austrian hopeful Dominic Thiem -- believes the eight-time champion is still the man to beat at this year's French Open. The 20-year-old Thiem admits Nadal was ""one of his idols"" growing up but showed little sign of being overawed as he detained the top seed for over two hours on Philippe Chatrier before succumbing to a 6-2 6-2 6-3 defeat in their second round match. But Thiem, the youngest man in the top 100 of the world rankings, currently occupying 57th spot, saw enough in Nadal's game to predict he will be holding the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy aloft on Sunday week. ""I think here in Roland Garros there are only a few man who can beat him, but yes he is the biggest favorite,"" Thiem told CNN. Nadal suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and in last week's Rome final to Novak Djokovic, but Thiem believes he is an altogether different proposition at the clay court grand slam. ""He's in his element at his favorite venue and he's really pumped up,"" he said. ""His top spin is really tough to counter and he didn't make a lot of mistakes."" After his victory, Nadal was also full of praise for his young opponent and applauded him off the court. ""He has completely everything to become a champion,"" he predicted. ""He as able to hit the ball very strong from the backhand and the forehand."" Thiem, who beat Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the second round of the Madrid Masters earlier this year, admitted to ""feeling a little bit nervous"" as he walked out on to the center court at a grand slam for the first time, .

ce82584a7eb91ba754d0c2b0ba156d85607cbf6e,"(CNN) -- Blaming the moon is a popular pastime. Police say crime rates go up during a full moon, nurses claim birth rates go up, authors set werewolves and vampires loose upon the land, and people think craziness abounds -- witness the word ""lunatic,"" which derives from ""luna,"" the Latin word for moon. None of this moon-linked strangeness has ever stood up to serious scrutiny. But now a team of astronomers at Texas State University-San Marcos has suggested that the moon can be blamed for the sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage 100 years ago. How the moon caused icebergs to litter the Titanic's path, on April 14, 1912, is really a story about the Earth's tides. What we now know about where icebergs originate and how they travel could have informed the Titanic's crew and perhaps avoided tragedy. But at the time, this science was in its infancy. The Titanic's captain did not expect icebergs to be a problem -- rarely did ice travel so far south into the Atlantic. Yet contemporaneous warnings from other ships suggested there were an unusual number of icebergs. Passengers reported seeing ice floes, lookouts spotted ice and sounded warnings, and other ships in the area reported fields of ice near the disaster site. Here's where astronomy comes in: Three months earlier, on January 4, 1912, the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years occurred within one day of the Earth's closest approach to the sun (which occurs once per year), all within minutes of a full moon, meaning the sun was perfectly aligned on the other side of the Earth (this happens every couple of weeks). The odds of all three events occurring at once are, well, astronomical. This lineup had to have caused unusually high tides in the North Atlantic. Tides are caused mostly by the differential pull of the moon's gravity on the Earth. The pull is strongest on the near side and weakest on the far side, since the strength of gravity, as Isaac Newton told us four centuries ago, falls as the s","Astronomers say the moon can be blamed for the sinking of the Titanic 100 years ago.

c37ca8d1da7ba73fadda466aa0f9c2d182cdcfa6,"(CNN) -- The changing black and white MRI images resembled a Rorschach test. Somewhere in these patterns was the story of my pain. I knew there was something wrong with my shoulders because it felt as if my arms were attached by rusty nails. Looking at the scans, the surgeon made it clear: I needed surgery in both shoulders. I couldn't accept this reality. These surgeries aren't just a giant setback for my career as an acrobat, they could pose a threat to my sobriety. I am a recovering heroin addict who cannot take opiate painkillers. I have witnessed many recovering addicts relapse after surgery. I've traveled this path myself after a few terrible root canals from another medical experience, and came crawling back to heroin. I've learned not to take any risks. How can I wager my recovery on the scales of justice? On one side sits surgery with the possibility of relapse. On the other sits an injured body in pain. How could I bargain the one element that has given me a beautiful and free life? Addict goes under the knife . My first fear revolves around the actual pain itself. Narcotic painkillers are the number one prescribed medication after surgery because painkillers kill pain. During my active addiction, I lived many years with the ability to eradicate pain at my own whim by simply pushing the end of a syringe. Now, in recovery, I must bow down and surrender to it. Is there a difference between eradicating pain and pain management? Do all opiate addicts have to suffer through physical painful situations? I've played this scenario out many times. I am prescribed narcotic painkillers after surgery, while holding on to the absolute perspective that no matter what, after six years of sobriety, I WILL NOT RETURN TO THE MADNESS OF ADDICTION. Depending on strength and dosage, I'm instructed to take one to two pills every four to six hours. It takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of the first pill. Can 20 minutes destroy a lifetime achievement? As the pill dissolve","Recovering heroin addict can't take opiate painkillers after surgery.

But Dennis Sorensen from Denmark is living proof that working appendages can reinstate senses as complicated as 'feeling'. The incredible technology, revealed by MailOnline last year, is the first bionic hand that allows the user to feel the sensation of touch though the device. The 36-year-old was fitted with the robotic limb, known as Lifehand 2, in Rome on January 26 2013 but the medical breakthrough has only now been shared. Dennis Sorensen of Denmark (left) has become the first amputee to be fitted with a bionic hand (right) that allows him to feel what he is touching in a groundbreaking medical procedure . 'The sensory feedback was incredible,' said Mr Sorensen, who spent a month trying out the hand. 'I could feel things that I hadn't been able to feel in over nine years. 'When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.' Mr Sorensen had his hand blown off in an horrific New Year's Eve firework accident at a neighbour's house in Aalborg, Denmark, where he still lives. Since then he has been wearing a . conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his . arm, allowing him to open and close his hand and grasp objects. But . without sensory information he cannot feel what he is trying to grasp, . making it difficult to gauge the amount of pressure needed. He now has to cope with the psychological challenge of having re-experienced a sense of touch only to lose it again.

The festival returned in 1946 and has since been a fertile ground for taboo-breaking films, wannabes disrobing for a shot at fame, public spats between directors and critics and publicity stunts gone wrong. The latest rumpus surrounds ""Grace of Monaco,"" a biopic of Grace Kelly, the Oscar-winning American actress who subsequently became the princess of Monaco. The film has been criticized by the Monaco royal family who said it contains ""major historical untruths and a series of purely fictional scenes.""

Cash-strapped families should not waste their money on organic food because they think it is healthier, the government has warned. Shoppers should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford, even if it means eating tinned or frozen vegetables which are in no way ‘nutritionally inferior’. The government now faces calls to end £20million of subsidies to organic farming, which owes ‘more to myth than evidence’. Critics want the government to end its £20million funding for the organic industry, arguing it does nothing to improve the health of the nation . A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops. But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option. Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government is at pains to stress that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’ Just 30 per cent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Among the lowest income groups, just 24 per cent of adults manage their Five-A-Day. Baroness Jolly added: ‘All fruit and vegetables count toward this, whether fresh or frozen, dried or canned, organic or not. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that there is a nutritional premium in some forms above others. ‘Frozen vegetables, for example, are as valuable as fresh in meeting our 'five a day'.’ The government encourages mothers who receive Healthy Start vouchers for fruit and vegetables ‘to get the best value for their vouchers, but we would not expect them to prioritise organic products’. She added:","Cash-strapped families should not spend money on organic food, government warns.

Just a few days ago, when Paul Ryan was selected by Mitt Romney to be his running mate, there was a burst of media euphoria. The nomination was a game changer. Ryan was an ideas guy. He would elevate what to date had been a lackluster campaign. He had killer abs. But within 48 hours, the so-called ""narrative"" had changed. The narrative is not actual facts. It is how those facts look after they've been run through the political spin cycle. Thanks to modern technology, the whole process of spinning narratives that once took weeks, now happens in the blinking of an eye. Twitter, in its manic frenzy, hopped up on bite-size bits of emotion-filled social interaction, condenses months into hours, news cycles into moments, but without any of the perspective that time or thought brings. Within a few ticks of the clock of Ryan bounding down the gangplank of the USS Wisconsin, he went from ""It boy"" to calamity. Comments about his hair and his missing necktie were so rapidly and extensively commented upon that they had become clichÃ©s before they could be written about in the next morning's paper. Saturday, he was a bold stroke. By Tuesday, Ryan was a potential liability. Old people were sure to hate him. And once an America that's a bit on the chubby side took note of his 6% body fat, he would be a goner. Ryan Rages Against the Machine . What had promised to be the beginning of a long overdue debate about ""big ideas"" was now seen, often by the same commentators who were upbeat days earlier, as a trigger for more hopelessly divisive bickering.

A judge has provoked fury by handing custody of a three-year-old girl to a registered sex offender. The ruling in Jacksonville, Florida, means little Miranda Wilkerson’s late mother’s husband, Donald Coleman, will gain custody of her. It means Miranda has to leave her maternal grandmother, Rita Manning, and move states to Georgia, where sex offender Mr Coleman lives. Stuck in the middle: Miranda Wilkerson is at the centre of a custody battle between her grandmother Rita Manning and sex offender father Donald Coleman . Mr Coleman became a sex offender after impregnating Miranda’s mother, Trista Crews Coleman, with another baby. Ms Coleman died one month after Miranda’s birth in a car crash, reported First Coast News. Ms Coleman was aged only 14 when she was first made pregnant, and he was 38. But he filed for divorce and claimed at one point she was pregnant with another man’s baby. However he is still Miranda’s legal father because he was married to her mother when she was born, reported WJXX-TV and ABC News. Mr Coleman had pushed for custody because Ms Manning was not allowing him to see Miranda, court documents alleged. In another confusing twist, Ms Manning was charged with child neglect in 1997, when Mr Coleman got her daughter pregnant, reported WJXX-TV. But Ms Manning fumed about the judge's decision and the custody transfer last Wednesday, saying the girl's 'whole world is here' with her. Parents: Donald Coleman, who lives in Georgia, became a sex offender after he impregnated Miranda's late mother, Trista Crews, right, with another baby .

Meles had not been seen in public in months, sparking intense international speculation about his health. The government revealed neither the cause nor the location of his death Monday at the age of 57. Meles came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator Haile Mengistu Mariam in 1991 and cemented power in the ensuing decades. Seen by admirers as a force for stability in a region with Islamist insurgencies in Somalia and Yemen and a history of famine, he was also criticized for cracking down on political opposition and the press. ""He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly,"" said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa. But he never overcame his ""mindset as a rebel leader,"" and his democratic credentials were ""poor,"" Johnson said. ""The West turned a blind eye to many aspects of his game that were not up to scratch,"" he added. That's partly because of his action against Islamist movements in the region, including an invasion of Somalia in 1998, Johnson said. ""He supported everything that the United States wanted to do against terror,"" he explained, such as give American drones based in the region permission to use Ethiopian airspace on their way to targets in Somalia. And ""he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care, education, reducing the poverty rate,"" Johnson said. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Meles' ""unyielding commitment to Ethiopia's poor"" in a statement Tuesday, citing his ""personal admiration for (Meles') desire to lift millions of Ethiopians out of poverty through his drive for food security.""

Two dogs from the pack that killed two people await euthanasia Tuesday at a shelter in northeast Georgia. Sheriff's deputies, code enforcement officers and other officials spent most of Monday and Tuesday rounding up 11 adult dogs and five puppies, Oglethorpe County Sheriff's Capt. Shalon Huff said. One more was trapped Wednesday morning, leaving one still to be captured, she said. ""We're just lucky this hasn't happened before,"" said Susan Fornash, director of the Madison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter in Danielsville, where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized Tuesday under orders from a local judge. ""We've had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that. And to me, that was just the forerunner of something like this."" Investigators say they believe that University of Georgia librarian Sherry Schweder, 65, went for her usual morning walk Saturday down Howard Thaxton Road, the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple's property. The dogs were familiar in the area, investigators say, having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane. Authorities theorize that halfway down the lane, about a quarter-mile from her home, Sherry Schweder was confronted by the dogs, which knocked her down and killed her. Her husband, retired UGA language professor Lothar Schweder, became concerned when she didn't return and went out in their Honda CRX to look for her. When he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs, they attacked and killed him too, investigators believe.

The 2012 compensation package for Cook, who took over as chief executive in August 2011, also seemed a pittance compared with his 2010 pay, which was 14 times higher, when the executive served as chief operating officer. Jobs, the iconic CEO and co-founder, died in October 2011 of pancreatic cancer. The maker of the iPhone and iPad noted that Cook will not receive any stock awards for 2012 after he was given about $376.2million in stock awards the year before. The stock awards vest over many years. The 2012 package includes a salary of $1.4million and a non-equity bonus of $2.8million, according to the filing. Apple tends to grant shares to executives every other year. Cook's closest cohorts got big grants in 2012, including top hardware engineer Robert Mansfield, who got shares worth $83million. Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer and general counsel Bruce Sewell both got stock grants worth just over $66million, more than double the value of the grants they got two years ago, reflecting the zooming value of Apple's stock. Cook's base salary actually increased compared with the $900,000 he earned in 2011. Founder: Cook is the successor of the late Steve Jobs, pictured, who died of pancreatic cancer last year .

ae4ceb3dbc77d35538a0d5c3ea5bbfdb91c6bc41,"(CNN) -- There's been plenty of talk about the gender pay gap in recent days after speculation that recently fired New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson was let go after speaking up about possible pay disparity between her and the previous executive editor, Bill Keller. In response to that talk, the New York Times publisher, in a lengthy statement over the weekend, said Abramson's total ""pay package,"" which included stock and other compensation in addition to salary, was ""comparable"" to Keller's and was, in fact, more than 10% higher during Abramson's last year, and that her removal was due to her management of the newsroom, nothing else. Until we hear Abramson's side of the story, it remains unclear what role, if any, an alleged pay gap played in her fate. What is clear is how outraged women were hearing that the Times' first woman executive editor could be making less than the last male executive editor. It was another reminder, to many women, that the income gap is alive and well. But if one city gets its way, that disparity between what men and women earn will become a thing of the past. Boston has pledged to become the first city in the country to eliminate the gender pay gap. It's certainly a lofty goal: How on Earth will Beantown make it happen? OPINION: Don't believe the hype: In real world, women still make less than men . On Monday, at a White House regional conference on working families in Boston, administration officials along with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, joined business leaders and academics, to tout the city's ambitious plan and what it will take to succeed. The event is one of several this spring leading up to a summit with President Obama at the end of June at the White House.

55d84176246ced039614ddb910b24e6256bf3f83,"(CNN) -- It was two hours before Friday's concert, and already fans of Jason Aldean were tailgating in the gravel parking lot. Not surprising since Aldean's ""My Kinda Party"" tour has sold out in venues across the country, often in under a couple of hours. Last week, the singer's latest single, ""Fly Over States,"" hit the top of the charts, marking his ninth No. 1 overall and his fifth consecutive No. 1 from the ""My Kinda Party"" album. Aldean's sound is a little bit country and a little bit rock 'n' roll. Introspective songs such as ""Amarillo Sky"" and ""Don't You Wanna Stay"" have earned him big sales numbers, but concert fans clamor for his more upbeat numbers such as ""She's Country."" He's also not afraid to step outside his comfort zone -- ""Dirt Road Anthem"" was a collaboration with Ludacris that had Aldean rapping about jumping barbed wire and lighting bonfires. Still, it surprised more than few people in the audience Friday when Ludacris appeared onstage with Aldean during the encore to perform the hit song. While tour buddy Luke Bryan has an infectious eagerness on stage, Aldean rarely breaks his brooding stare. That doesn't change backstage as his tour manager brings him in. He's friendly, but no overly so. I get the impression that manners are as ingrained in this Georgia homeboy as deep as his music. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: .

Stoke could affect patients' moral compass, altering they way they think about mistakes and people's intentions, a new study has found. Scientists in Buenos Aires found those victims who suffered a stroke affecting the frontal region of the brain were more likely to forgive, as long as no actual harm was done. The study concluded the effect on moral judgement was similar to those patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

""My friends and I joke that motherhood 'drives us to drink,' but sometimes it really does for me,"" she said. ""I feel like I need it to unwind,"" she said.

A black woman firearms officer said she suffered ‘13 months of hell’ before a criminal inquiry into her conduct was dropped yesterday. PC Carol Howard, 35, claimed the inquiry only went on for so long because she had successfully challenged racism and sexism in the Metropolitan Police. The officer, who was the force’s Olympics security poster girl in 2012, learned she will face no further action over claims linked to a dispute with her ex-husband. Last night, she said: ‘I’m appalled and disgusted that the police put me through 13 months of hell simply because I stood up to the Met Police and challenged the discrimination at work. ‘As a working officer, I know these allegations would not normally have been investigated in this way and for this long. 'I was punished for challenging them and they tried to smear me. Lessons need to be learned by the police, and quickly.’ Sussex Police had investigated a string of incidents which allegedly took place in 2012-2013. But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges of perverting the course of  justice and harassment. A claim of common assault was not pursued as the alleged incident took place more than two years ago and there is a six-month limit on the offence. A further claim that PC Howard possessed an indecent image of a child was dropped as the photograph was of her daughter. This month, the elite officer was awarded £37,000 for suffering appalling treatment in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. Judges found PC Howard was targeted for almost a year by a senior officer while working in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group.

Millions of people will take two days off work for a double Bank Holiday on June 4 and 5 as Queen Elizabeth II marks 60 years on the throne.

Celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could keep the UK in recession, warned Bank of England boss Mervyn King (right) But Sir Mervyn King warned yesterday that this year's celebrations will knock 0.5 of a percentage point off economic output between April and May. The decline could hinder efforts to haul Britain's fragile economy out of recession as the crisis in the Eurozone continues to dampen growth. While Sir Mervyn said the bigger picture was one of gradual recovery in growth, the impact of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could  prolong the double-dip recession. Many workers are set to use the Monday and Tuesday bank holidays as the start of a whole week off, costing them just three days of annual leave. The remarks are a blow to David Cameron, who said in his New Year message that the Jubilee and the Olympics meant 2012 ‘must be the year we go for it’. A sign of parties to come: Confetti falls and flags fly from Harrods in London yesterday as the store celebrates the forthcoming Jubilee . In the same period last year, the economy fell short of expectations and grew by just 0.2 per cent.

A leading Norwegian MP has called for French people to be banned from visiting his country because they are 'notorious criminals'. Per Sandberg - who is head of parliament's judicial affairs committee - said large groups of tourists from France, Romania and Bulgaria should be stopped at the border. The deputy leader of the main opposition Progress Party said: 'We need immediate measures to stop the influx of begging and crime. 'At the borders, police can under existing laws stop organised groups of Romanians, Bulgarians or French because we know from experience that these people disrupt the peace.' And he added in the statement posted online: 'It has also been proven that they are notorious for engaging in criminal activities.' The remarks have caused outrage in the French media, where France Info news said: 'We French are certainly not more criminally inclined than anyone else. 'This man is an idiot in ski boots. Why pick on us?' It is not the first time Mr Sandberg has stirred up controversy with his extreme views. Sandberg is the deputy leader of the opposition Progress Party in the Norwegian parliament, which sits in the Storting , pictured .

While sparing much of New York and New Jersey, the much talked-about storm managed to wallop parts of New England on Tuesday. And even after producing coastal flooding and dropping several feet of snow (including 30 inches in Framingham, Massachusetts, and up to 6-foot drifts statewide), there's more to come. ""We fully expect that there are parts of eastern and central Massachusetts where people may get ... another 5 to 10 inches of snow,"" Gov. Charlie Baker said around midday. ""... And there are areas around eastern Massachusetts, at this point, that you would probably describe as being in a whiteout-type condition."" Massachusetts wasn't the only state getting hit hard Tuesday afternoon.

It's not just the snow. East-facing coastal areas -- already coping with early morning flooding, heavy snow and potent winds -- are bracing for a new high tide and the storm surge expected with it around 5 p.m. Nantucket and its 15,000 residents ""lost power to the entire island,"" said police Chief William Pittman, a situation he attributed to sustained winds of roughly 50 mph, punctuated by gusts of around 80 mph.

The world No. 7 revealed that the virus had affected him when losing to Frenchman Benoit Paire in last week's Rome Masters. The 24-year-old's withdrawal follows that of world No. 2 Andy Murray, who pulled out of the year's second grand slam with a back injury. ""This is a tough blow, because these are the events you dream of winning,"" said del Potro, who won the U.S. Open in 2009, on the ATP website. ""Now I must get over this disappointment and recover completely in order to prepare at 100% for the tests to come."" The virus affecting Del Potro had prompted the tall right-hander to miss recent tournaments in Portugal and Madrid, and he returned in Italy with the hope of being able to compete at the French Open. Despite his exit in the third round, he will always remember his time in the Italian capital after meeting with the Pope, a fellow Argentine, last week -- an experience del Potro said he would ""never forget"". Del Potro reached the semifinals of Roland Garros in 2009 and the quarterfinals last year -- only to be beaten by Roger Federer on both occasions. He was joined in withdrawing from next week's event by former world number seven Mardy Fish, who is now ranked 41st in the world, and fellow American Brian Baker -- whose absences had been expected. Also on Wednesday, Caroline Wozniacki's terrible 2013 continued when the number one seed was beaten in straight sets by China's Zheng Jie at the Brussels Open. The former world number one from Denmark is on a terrible recent run of form, having now added a first round exit in Brussels to those suffered in Italy, Spain and Germany in the last month alone.

It also set off a frenzied partisan debate over religious and reproductive rights that will continue through the November congressional elections and beyond. All five conservative justices appointed by Republican presidents ruled in favor of closely held for-profit businesses -- those with at least 50% of stock held by five or fewer people, such as family-owned businesses -- in which the owners have clear religious beliefs. Contraceptives or abortion? Both corporations involved in Monday's rulng -- Conestoga Wood Specialties of Pennsylvania and Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based arts-and-crafts retail giant -- emphasize their conscientious desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace.

One of the peculiar laws of quantum physics is that a particle can be in two different physical states at the same time - like how the Cheshire Cat could separate itself from its smile. If, for example, a beam of neutrons is divided into two beams using a silicon crystal, it can be shown that the individual neutrons can travel simultaneously along both paths in what is known as a ‘quantum superposition’. And now scientists have measured this bizarre property, which means that they might be able to control the behaviour of neutrons in future . Scientists have observed for the first time a weird quantum phenomenon known as the 'Cheshire Cat' effect (illustration shown). The 'cat' in question was a subatomic neutron particle, and the ghostly 'grin' the particle’s magnetic moment, which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field . The groundbreaking research was performed by an team at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France. The quantum Cheshire Cat follows in the paw steps of Schrodinger’s cat, the most famous feline to make an impact on the world of physics. In Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger’s celebrated 1935 thought experiment, a cat that is both alive and dead was used to illustrate the apparent paradox of quantum superposition. The imaginary experiment involved a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity, caused by the decay of a single atomic particle, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. Theoretically the particle can be in a superposition of a decayed and non-decayed state at the same time, logically leading to the cat being both dead and alive. But this state of affairs only lasts until the box is opened. Once an observer peers inside the box, a cat that is either alive or dead is revealed. Researchers from the Vienna University of Technology performed this separation of a particle from","Scientists in Grenoble, France, have observed the 'Cheshire Cat' effect. A particle can be in two different physical states at the same time. This is known as a ‘quantum superposition’ and can be seen in beams of neutrons.

Northampton look set to mount a robust defence of their captain after he was sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face at Franklin's Gardens on Saturday.

Hartley (right) was adjudged to elbow Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens . Hartley cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. The Rugby Football Union has yet to confirm when 28-year-old Hartley's hearing will take place but moves are afoot for it to be held on Tuesday evening. Hartley was handed a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007, and an 11-week suspension for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the 2013 Aviva Premiership final against Leicester. That latter ban led to him missing the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, and RFU disciplinary chiefs could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion.

Blairite MP Liz Kendall is being widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May, it emerged yesterday. The Leicester West MP is a member of a ‘breakfast club’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. All four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in Portcullis House before meetings of Mr Miliband’s shadow cabinet. Many MPs from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the Blair/Brown wars of the past if Labour doesn’t win in May. A clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers. Other challengers are likely to include Andy Burnham, the party’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at Labour conference last year. Mr Burnham’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the NHS from further privatisation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a Labour loss. Her husband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily. Yesterday the Independent on Sunday reported Miss Kendall, a Leicester MP, had emerged as the favourite among Blairites impressed by her TV performances. It was also suggested that the quartet of Blairites will unite to try and block Mr Burnham, and suggested Mr Umunna would also be a likely candidate.

The rise in ‘community justice’ means crimes as serious as murder and sexual abuse are going unreported – a situation reminiscent of Belfast in the height of the Troubles. Tom Winsor said police officers were simply never called to some neighbourhoods, where law-abiding people rather than criminals administer their own form of justice . Honour killings, genital mutilation, and domestic violence are some of the offences thought to be unreported . He said: ‘There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve the police at all. I am reluctant to name the communities in question, but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves. ‘There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own. ‘It’s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or don’t want to go into those areas,’ he said. ‘But if the police don’t get calls for help then, of course, they won’t know what’s going on.’ Honour killings, domestic violence, sexual abuse of children and female genital mutilations are some of the offences that are believed to be unreported in some cities. Last December, three members of a self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ vigilante group were jailed for harassing, intimidating and assaulting people in East London while claiming they were enforcing sharia law. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor warns police officers are never called to some areas . In an interview with The Times, Mr Winsor said: ‘It could be anything. [Honour killings] are the most extreme case. That is murder. There is no honour in it.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the rising number of unreported crimes was a damning indictment of our police. He told the Mail last night: ‘","Rise in 'community justice' means crimes as serious as murder and sexual abuse are going unreported.

4f6e32274ef09ee7fde840a175bdf199c18abf01,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles inventor who photographed Michael Jackson 33 years ago hopes those images will now help launch an electric motor he claims could solve the world's energy problems. Reginald Garcia will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished Jackson photos to fund testing of the motor, which he claims generates more electricity than it uses. Garcia is in the process of getting the photos appraised and prepared for sale. The photos show a 19-year-old Jackson and his brothers during a video shoot at a Hollywood studio in March 1978, before he began changing his appearance with surgery. The Afro hair style and 1970s clothing show ""a rare glance"" of Jackson in an ""awkward teenage stage,"" an image that he personally tried to bury in later years, according to a collector who sold photographs to the singer. ""If it was an image he didn't like, he was more likely to buy them than if they were images he did like,"" said Keya Morgan. ""Were he alive now, I would definitely go to him and I'm sure he would want to buy them."" With Jackson gone, Morgan's Keya Gallery is buying the image copyrights and helping Reginald Garcia sell the original slides, prints and contact sheets that have been forgotten on his shelf for decades. Garcia pulled the box of photos out of his closet last month when he was looking for ways to finance testing of his ""self-generating"" motor, Garcia said in a CNN interview this week. ""He was the greatest guy you could ever talk to,"" Garcia said of his day with Jackson. Garcia was a student at California Tech and a freelance photographer when a friend of his sister's, who worked for CBS Records, asked him to take pictures of the Jacksons at Gower Studios in Hollywood, he said. The color photos show the Jackson 5 dressed in blue tuxedos, singing on a soundstage. The black-and-white images were taken during breaks in the video shoot, Garcia said.

76aaa70a0f9f602bfddf30cdf3c7f3f7c281ece2,"MADRID, Spain -- Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row as Barcelona defeated big-spending Atletico Madrid 3-0 to stay in touch with Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid. Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. ""It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,"" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. ""We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit."" ""Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,"" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schuster's rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. ""It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty,"" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben.

A toddler who suffered a fatal wound to the head was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, despite no-one being charged over her death. An inquest into the death of Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who was 21 months old when she died, heard she was subjected to a non-accidental 'blunt force trauma'. Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder after her death because all three had cared for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been hit. Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death . Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services. But a coroner has now ruled she was 'unlawfully killed' The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no-one could be prosecuted over her death because it could not be established whether it was her mother, stepfather or maternal grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured. At the end of an inquest today, Assistant Deputy Coroner Oliver Longstaff said the non-accidental nature of the injury had been established not merely on the 'balance of probabilities', but also 'beyond reasonable doubt', as is necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts. He said: 'In my view, and to the criminal standard of proof, I am satisfied that whatever the state of mind of the perpetrator of the act that caused Summer's ultimately fatal injury, it would have been obvious to that perpetrator that Summer was being subjected to forces far in excess of anything she might have been expected to withstand, and which were overwhelmingly likely to cause her very significant injury.

Coroner Roger Hatch ruled said the reason the student's car left the A21 in Kent was the failure of the Highways Agency to maintain the road, despite evidence of a worsening safety record. Mr Hatch heard how the Highways Agency had been repeatedly warned the road was unsafe. But the inquest heard the authority failed to take action in the three years before Lucy’s death. Her family, including dad Richard, mum Charlotte, sisters Amy, 22, Katie, 18, and brother Jack, 16, were at the inquest to hear the verdict that Lucy was not at fault for the accident.

It is considered a basic right by many Americans and Barack Obama has shown no inclination to significantly tighten gun control laws in the wake of the weekend shootings at a cinema.

White House press secretary Jay Carney, was quoted on abc News today saying that Obama’s views have not altered since 12 people died in shootings at the Dark Knight Rises Batman premiere in Aurora, Colorado. Mr Carney said: ‘He [the president] believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights of the American people but that ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons.' The announcement is in keeping with the position the president has taken throughout his tenure, namely to avoid a conflict with the powerful National Rifle Association.

Gordon Ramsay may have a reputation for being one of the most brutal head chefs in the restaurant business, but it seems his rivals are capable of being equally devious. Mr Ramsay claims that a competitor sabotaged the opening night of his new restaurant by secretly booking 100 out of 140 tables, leaving the eatery almost empty. The television chef said staff at Heddon Street Kitchen, in London's Mayfair, were left upset and deflated, and will now have to reconfirm every booking to ensure they are not caught out again. He refused to name the rival he believes was involved, but said it showed the 'level of envy' on the restaurant scene while speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast on ITV tonight. Ramsay's new eatery is described as having a 'relaxed' atmosphere and 'modern European' menu which is ideal for 'brisk brunches and post-shopping pit stops through to lunch, dinners and after work cocktails.' The kitchen is run by head chef Maria Tampakis who grew up New York and worked for three-Michelin starred chef Jean Georges at Cook before moving to London. She worked briefly for Heston Blumenthal at his Knightsbridge restaurant Dinner, moved to Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen, near St Paul's Cathedral, as head sous chef before being moved to the head of Heddon Street Kitchen. The new opening marks Ramsay's 12th restaurant in the capital, and brings his total number of eateries up to 24 worldwide - sharing seven Michelin stars between them.

Some would be replaced by a ""Village Post Office"" located within a commercial retail store. Postmaster General Patrick Donohoe planned a news conference Tuesday to release a long-awaited ""post office study list"" of potential closings nationwide, typically targeting rural post offices where only a few hundred customers are served. The facilities targeted, potentially numbering in the thousands, will be subject to a review and appeals process before any final decision is made. The list was developed based on low workload among post office employees, a small number of customers, and whether that location could be combined with other postal facilities nearby. The list to be released Tuesday has 3,653 facilities named, according to materials CNN obtained. They are categorized as follows: . GROUP 1: Less than $27,500 in annual revenue; less than 2 hours of workload daily (3,061) GROUP 2: Less than $600,000 in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 2 miles (385) GROUP 3: Less than $1 million in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 0.5 miles (188) GROUP 4: Offices currently suspended (19) Donohoe is also expected to provide details of a plan to increase joint marketing with other retailers as a way to improve customer access to postal services. A presentation obtained by CNN includes a drawing of a small grocery storefront, combined with signage suggesting the building is also a ""Village Post Office,"" complete with signs featuring the stylized logo of the postal service. In May, Donohoe told CNN, ""You've got a post office, a gas station, and a store; they're in a small town, the gas station and the store are struggling, we think we can provide service through contracts in many cases,"" that could cut operating costs for the Postal Service.

Blunder: Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital . A hospital which suppressed details of the blunders that led to a teenage girl’s death to avoid causing stress to staff was forced to back down yesterday. Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation. The trainee hairdresser texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend shortly before she died. An inquest in December was told that Kettering General Hospital had uncovered 43 errors in the teenager’s care. But the Northamptonshire hospital insisted that publishing details of the blunders could ‘endanger the mental health’ of their staff. It released the internal report to Victoria’s devastated father Andrew Harrison, 57, and mother Tracy Foskett, 42, but said it had a right to withhold information from the public. Details were released – with staff names redacted – after the BBC appealed under the Freedom of Information Act against the hospital’s refusal to release its findings. An internal panel agreed it was in the public interest to reveal the mistakes and the report’s recommendations. The report says staff did not check Miss Harrison’s abdomen, routine observations were discontinued, there was no formal pain assessment, there was inaccurate recording of her resuscitation, the wrong surgeon was named on documentation and nurses’ conduct was unprofessional. It reveals that ten staff were disciplined, but none dismissed. The case comes after recent assurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected as part of efforts to create a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS, which the minister said was vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The pilot of the second Continental Connection flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo, New York, reported ""moderate icing"" during the trip and ""made it to destination in Buffalo,"" said Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board. The second plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, like the plane that crashed Thursday night near the Buffalo airport, killing 49 people on board and one person on the ground. Also like the fatal flight, the aircraft was operated on the Continental Connection route by Colgan Air, Chealander said. Possible icing -- and how the aircraft and the flight crew performed if icing was an issue -- has become a focus in the aftermath of the crash of Flight 3407. The pilot and first officer of the flight discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the NTSB said after listening to the cockpit voice recorder. Chealander said Monday that he had been asked about possible icing on the aircraft's tail. ""If there's icing on the wings, there's icing on the tail,"" he said. ""The significance of that is yet to be determined."" The flight data recorder indicated the plane's deicing system was activated 11 minutes after takeoff from Newark and remained on until the crash, according to the NTSB. Chealander said investigators have recovered most of the pieces of that system and will examine those materials to determine whether the system was operating properly. Chealander also said questionnaires were being sent to every pilot who flew in the Buffalo vicinity the night of the crash to find out what icing conditions they might have encountered.

77b8da04408b0a305a26456d49c7adfe2d137d0d,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Just call it the anti-protest protest. Tens of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong yesterday in support of China and to protest Occupy Central, a pro-democracy movement that says it will plan to stage a civil disobedience sit-in unless the Chinese government allows the Hong Kong public to nominate and vote for its next leader. Robert Chow, the organizer of Sunday's march, said it represented Hong Kong's desire to work ""peacefully"" with the Chinese government in Beijing on political reform. ""We want universal suffrage, but not at any cost,"" he told CNN Monday. The pro-government march followed the same route as Hong Kong's massive annual anti-government, pro-democracy rally on July 1, but the tenor was markedly different: Sunday's marchers were arranged into organized groups wearing matching t-shirts, some emblazoned with names of mainland Chinese organizations. Many waved Chinese flags. Paid protester claim . Local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march. One video (Cantonese) purportedly showed cash being handed out to marchers. Other images appeared to show marchers getting paid and enjoying free food in a dim-sum restaurant. Chow said he took the bribery accusations ""seriously"" and would ""investigate"" but maintained that no laws were broken. There were also conflicting reports on the size of the march. Chow said his group counted a ""quarter million"" marchers, but an estimate by University of Hong Kong statisticians put the number much lower, between 79,000 and 88,000. By contrast, July's pro-democracy rally drew between 154,000 and 172,000, according to the university. Pictures taken by reporters appeared to show a noticeably thinner crowd on Sunday than the crowd in July, but Chow said the difference was because ""we were marching very, very fast.""

9674c790966de344a4a34a39dc19a9bf2ef635fd,"(CNN)  -- Mexican smugglers trying to find new routes into the United States are turning increasingly to the Pacific Ocean for a short sail to the California coast, where they drop off illegal immigrants and marijuana, U.S. officials say. The Pacific Ocean around the California coastline is being used more often by Mexican smugglers. The water route has become particularly popular in the past year. ""We've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water,"" said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in San Diego, California. ""It's become very, very risky and difficult to cross by land. Smugglers try to jump where they think we're not looking."" U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris, the top-ranking Coast Guard official at the Port of San Diego, said interdictions of human cargo on the Pacific have doubled since last year. Drug busts -- all marijuana -- are even higher, he said. ""Drug interdictions are six times above what they were last year,"" Farris told CNN Wednesday. So far this year, he said, authorities have confiscated 60,000 pounds of marijuana and caught 400 people trying to sneak into the United States. The water route has become popular, he said, because ""the land border has been so severely closed by Customs and border agents."" That land route was particularly difficult Tuesday for smugglers who tried to speed three vans full of illegal immigrants through the San Ysidro border crossing between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California. San Ysidro is the busiest land border crossing in the world, with up to 45,000 cars and 95,000 people passing through each day. One Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and two Customs and Border Protection agents opened fire, wounding two suspects, officials said. Another two people were injured when one of the vans crashed into another vehicle. More than 70 people aboard the three vans were captured as were two of the drivers, authorities said.

Rolf Harris groped a 15-year-old girl's breast after telling her to give him a hug, before rubbing his groin against her mother's behind, a court heard. Harris, 84, approached the girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - at an event in an Australian shop in 1991, Southwark Crown Court heard. The teenager later told her mother what happened - and described Harris as a 'dirty old man' - but did not take the complaint further for fear of making a fuss. Speaking to the court via video-link, the woman said: 'He put his right hand on my left breast and through my shirt. I had a shirt that was gathered and did not have buttons on the front. 'He put his other hand on my right butt cheek. His hand was over my bra but through my shirt. 'It was very deliberate. I stepped back and he laughed'. She recalled pulling away from him and then making her way back in to the crowd. Now a mother-of-five, the woman told the court: 'I was in shock and I stayed away from him'. The court also heard evidence from her mother, who said Harris rubbed his groin against her while a photograph was being taken. She said she called him a 'disgusting creature', which made him 'sneer' at her. Harris stands accused of 12 counts of indecent assault between 1968 and 1986, and denies all charges.

But now the daily pint is to be delivered by the Germans across much of the country. Surrey-based Dairy Crest has sold all of its dairies and 3,000 milk floats to Bavaria’s Müller for £80million. End of an era: Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said it didn't matter who owns the company . Müller – which sells dairy products around the world – will take control of four dairies at Severnside, near Bristol, Chadwell Heath, east London, Foston, Derbyshire, and Hanworth, in Birmingham, as well as around 70 depots. Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said: ‘It may be owned by a German firm but consumers love the milkman – it doesn’t matter who owns the company.’ It marks an end of an era for Dairy Crest, as milk represented around 70 per cent of their business. The firm will now focus on their Country Life butter and Cathedral City cheese brands. Mr Allen added: ‘In the months ahead we will do all we can to minimise the uncertainty that we know today’s news will bring for the many people associated with our business.’ Dairy Crest, Britain’s largest dairy food company, has struggled to pass on higher raw milk prices it paid to farmers last year and has been losing customers to supermarket chains, which offer cheaper milk. The company’s dairies swung to a loss of £4.4million for the six months to the end of September from a profit of £2.6million a year earlier. The deal adds to Müller’s growing presence in the British dairy industry. In 2012, the firm took over Scotland’s Robert Wiseman Dairies and already owns nine dairies and ten depots nationwide, employing almost 6,000 people. Ronald Kers, chief executive of Müller UK & Ireland, said: ‘We are concerned that the dynamics of the UK fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term.

5a27b57613583c63221f6f5f694f2b041c74c48c,"(CNN) -- Hamas is pushing a different tactic in its conflict with Israel, urging Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes. The idea of pursuing an investigation into Israel by the international body is not new, but Hamas said on Saturday that it, too, has signed a document supporting such a move. ""Hamas has signed a document demanding Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) go to the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders as war criminals for massacres they committed against our people,"" Hamas spokesman and senior official Izzat al-Risheq said on Twitter. The support from Hamas is significant because it could come at a cost to the group itself. An investigation into war crimes could expose Hamas for its own violations. Abbas, speaking in Cairo, said that all Palestinian factions would need to support such a bid before making the decision to go to the ICC. The Palestinians are not currently under the jurisdiction of the ICC, but would be if they sign the court's Rome Statute, the treaty that established the court. Back in May, a group of 17 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, signed a letter to Abbas encouraging him to join the ICC. The United States and Israel, among some other nations, have pressured Abbas not to take this step, arguing that it would harm peace talks. Hamas' announcement comes a day after one of the group's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June. Hamas Political Bureau member Saleh Aruri added that the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action. The kidnappings were not approved by Hamas leadership or its military wing, he said, stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility.

a9f936914cfd65d3f4e0fd74d9f85a807088dbce,"(Health.com) -- Waste happens. Every cook knows that. Still, discovering wilted herbs or a loaf of stale bread can make you feel careless. Plus, tossing out food is expensive! The average American household discards between $500 and $2,000 worth of food a year. But there are clever ways to minimize waste, by storing food carefully or preserving it at its peak to enjoy later, says Sherri Brooks Vinton, author of ""Put 'Em Up,"" a book about preserving food. Here, a few of our favorites. Bread . The problem: You bought more loaves than you need. Use it now: Cooks the world over have come up with smart ways to use old bread. A super-quick one: croutons. Cut bread into cubes, toss with a little olive oil and salt, and toast in a 275-degree oven for about 20 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden. Cool, then store in an airtight container for up to two weeks. They're delicious in soups and salads, or crushed and sprinkled over pasta. Save it for later: While it's still fresh, place a sliced loaf right in the freezer. Then, pull out slices as you need them and pop them in the toaster. ""People don't think of the freezer as a preserving mechanism, but it is,"" Vinton says. Health.com: Essential items for a healthy pantry . Fresh fruit . The problem: Buying fruit in season is wise. ""The vitamin content of seasonal produce is at its peak,"" says Christina Munsell, research associate at the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. But we often buy more than we can eat. Use it now: You don't need a recipe to make fruit salad -- most kinds go together naturally. Just cut up what you have (skip bananas, which go mushy; see the tip below). Add one-quarter teaspoon of vanilla, a generous squeeze of citrus (to slow browning), and a drizzle of honey. Set the bowl front and center in your fridge; it'll be the first thing everyone sees when they go snack-hunting. 40% of U.S. food wasted, report says .

On Friday, the plane chartered by the Spanish government landed at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) at Madrid's Barajas airport and carried the 37 former prisoners and 208 of their relatives. There was no news conference at the airport. Instead, non-governmental organizations that have helped the former prisoners with lodging boarded almost all of them and their families onto buses which headed to 15 destinations across Spain, including Barcelona and Malaga, the diplomat said. Centers in Madrid are already at capacity with other former prisoners, the diplomat said, and that's why most of the latest arrivals were sent elsewhere.","NEW: The latest arrivals are the last of a group of political prisoners.

Mario Balotelli appears to drift through games but he's actually working harder than you'd think. He covered 5.2 miles in his 79 minutes against Chelsea. That is equivalent to 5.8 miles across 90 minutes – which just happens to be the average distance covered by Luis Suarez in games against the top four last season. Mario Balotelli may not be finding the net with the same regularity as Luis Suarez did at Liverpool, but he is running the same as the Uruguayan did against the top four teams last season . 2. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season - and the left back, who made his Wales debut in the summer, has now also proved he can play as a central defender. The 23-year-old product of the club's youth system performed brilliantly alongside Fabricio Coloccini in the 2-0 win at West Brom, keeping new England star Saido Berahino to just one shot on goal. His 13 clearances were more than the rest of Newcastle's defenders put together. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season . 3. Gareth Barry's nasty injury at Sunderland gave Darron Gibson a chance to return to Premier League action – and the former Manchester United midfielder seized the opportunity. The 26-year-old, out for 11 months after cruciate ligament surgery, had played just eight minutes of League football so far. But after replacing Barry at Sunderland with just 13 minutes gone he performed like he'd not been away. No Premier League player all weekend hit more accurate passes in the attacking half than the 52 that Gibson produced – just a shame none of them got turned into a goal in the 1-1 draw.

Todashev attacked an FBI agent, who shot him dead, a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. ""He used some kind of weapon,"" the official said, and that prompted the FBI agent to shoot the suspect. A second law enforcement official confirmed Todashev made the confession. The unsolved triple murder received renewed interest after it was learned that Tsarnaev was sparring partners at a local gym with one of the victims.

Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force. Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a ""symbolic gesture,"" and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene. Todashev told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and Tsarnaev were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened, according to a law enforcement source. So far, no link has been found between Todashev and the Boston Marathon bombings.

Big payout: An Essex secondary school pupil received over £15,000 in compensation after his eyebrow was slightly cut by a DVD case thrown to him by a teacher . A schoolboy was awarded £15,197 in compensation after he sustained a 'tiny cut to the eyebrow' when a teacher threw a DVD case to him. The plastic case accidentally hit the secondary school pupil in the head, with the boy’s family successfully claiming the five-figure pay-out from Essex County Council. The council said the member of staff was attempting to pass the DVD cover to the pupil but 'unintentionally threw it with more force than expected and it accidentally hit him'. It said: 'The damages were agreed in accordance with the guidelines of the Judicial College Guidelines. 'The claimant suffered a scar which was permanent and represented a moderate cosmetic deformity.' The council paid out £7,900 for the family's solicitors' legal costs, £6,750 in damages and £547 in NHS costs. Critics have . now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in Essex schools. In total £65,586 of taxpayers' money was awarded by Essex council to pupils that successfully sued over injuries between 2011 and 2013, including one who received £16,812 after hurting his hip falling on wet stairs, according to The Sun. Essex teachers are suing schools, too. Thirty-four payouts were handed to injured teachers in the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of £1.05million.

That wasn't Sandiford's experience growing up in a black family outside of the United States, where it wasn't unusual to see women breast-feed openly in public. She remembers seeing her mother breast-feed her sister and knew that one day she, too, would breast-feed her children. When she turned to the Internet in 2009 for support after her son's birth, she noticed that most images and personal stories did not include black women. Or, when conversations included black women, they focused on how they breast-feed at lower rates than other racial groups.

4380de937e5e9c5ddec71973b7c1e9dd94e1f6be,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Home to some 70 million Muslims, Nigeria is stepping up efforts to capitalize on the growing popularity of the one of the world's fastest-growing financial sectors: Islamic banking. Earlier this year the Central Bank of Nigeria announced a final set of regulations which introduced Islamic banking to the country. CNN's Christian Purefoy discussed the sector's potential with Hajara Adeola, managing director of Lotus Capital, one of the groups helping to pave the way for Islamic finance in Nigeria. Adeola says there is a growing appetite for this form of banking. ""It is working in Nigeria and there is a lot of interest in doing Islamic banking, in West Africa in particular,"" she says. Spread across the Middle East and other parts of the world, a slew of Islamic financial institutions have been offering interest-free services that advocates say can provide a more sustainable alternative to conventional banking practices. The industry, which exists in more than 50 countries, is estimated to be worth around $1 trillion and has the potential to eventually be worth $5 trillion, according to ratings agency Moody's. Charging and paying interest is not allowed in Islamic finance because it is prohibited under Sharia law. Instead, if a bank is providing finance for an infrastructure project, for example, the bank and customer agree to share the risk of investment and divide any earnings. ""One of the most well known (principles) is the lack of interest or usury, so you can't own a return simply for having money -- which is what interest is,"" Adeola says. ""You would have to somehow employ that money into productive use and then you can earn a return on that money."" Islamic banks are not allowed to trade in financial risk areas or deal in mortgage-backed securities or credit-default swaps. Investing in Islamically unacceptable businesses such as alcohol and cigarette makers, casinos and adult-entertainment companies is also forbidden.

A patrolling police officer was the first to report the fire that broke out in the Woonsocket house around 4pm on March 15. Officer Scott Breguet found Latraverse with her three children - ages two, nine and 12 - safely outside the home with their two dogs. Latraverse's hair was singed and she had burn marks on her jacket. The family was taken to Rhode Island Hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. Though it was a multi-family building, no one else was inside at the time of the fire. Witnesses told Officer Breguet that 'they overheard other neighbors talking about how Corrine had told people on the way out of the house that she had burned the house down with a can of gas' Another witness said the couple living in the apartment had been having 'domestic issues' and had bought the property to 'fix things' after they both cheated on each other. Latraverse allegedly got into a fight with her boyfriend of 15 years the day before the fire when she caught him talking on the phone with another woman.

According to figures of graduate salaries, computer scientists from Oxford receive the most lucrative pay packets after graduating, earning an average of £43,895 six months after leaving university. Computer scientists from Oxford University (pictured), have emerged as the top-earning graduates . Google co-founder Larry Page (pictured) studied computer science at Stanford University - he is now worth $31.7billion . Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg read computer science at Harvard and is now worth $33.1b . The figure is almost four times that of graduates in drama, dance and cinematics from Essex University, the lowest earners on just £11,963. Professor Michael Wooldridge (pictured) attributed the success of his graduates to an 'uncompromising insistence on mathematical clarity' Famous graduates of computer science include Google co founder, Larry Page, and Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg. Professor Michael Wooldridge, head of the computer science department at Oxford University, told Sian Griffiths, of the Sunday Times: 'Ultimately, our students are trained to think clearly, rigorously and deeply about complex problems.' 'Computers are the future and computer science courses command a salary premium', agreed Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University. The tables also highlight the growing gap between the highest and lowest earning graduates and found that one in 10 had not got a job six months after leaving university. Graduates in computer science from Imperial College London and Cambridge also feature in the top 10 for earnings. Science degrees are increasingly the path to higher earnings, the figures reveal, with engineering, medicine, veterinary science and dentistry all performing well.

Mr Stewart said: 'People have a viewpoint of Hong Kong as an ugly city and I wanted to show it in a different light. 'The purpose of images like these is to overwhelm the viewer as there is just too much to take in on first viewing. 'I love all the intricate details that make up a cityscape and my hope is that it grabs the viewers attention enough to want to explore it more in finer detail. He added: 'There is simply just so much to see and document in Hong Kong that it can fill the niche for any photographer. 'All of these images were taken at night, when the city is at its most vibrant. 'Using a tripod allows me to shoot using a longer shutter speed at night so I can capture as much ambient light as I please - provided the city is playing fair that evening and not covered in fog.'

432a3211d2316b270fa3b889bfaf1073f10a9965,"(CNN) -- With 20 U.S. states allowing medical marijuana, and others weighing its medicinal or recreational use, advocates of looser laws on weed appear to have the advantage. But leading medical groups remain ambivalent, and opponents are now trying to mobilize for upcoming votes in three states. Florida will vote on whether to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in November. In New York and Georgia, the state legislatures are debating medical marijuana, while the District of Columbia City Council voted Tuesday to decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot. Meanwhile, two more states -- Oregon and Alaska -- are expected to follow the lead of Colorado and Washington and put full legalization on the ballot in 2014. And in the year-plus since the Colorado and Washington votes, public opinion has swung sharply in favor of loosening marijuana laws. ""That caught everyone, even advocates, by surprise,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance. In January, a CNN/ORC International survey found 55% support for legalization, with 44% opposing it. National polls shifted by about 10 percentage points between late 2012 and late 2013, with support for legalization climbing to roughly the same level seen in the CNN poll, Nadelmann said. ""A lot of people just began to relax and see the sky's not going to fall. All we're doing is moving a booming market from the underground to the legal world,"" he said. Those trends were seen even in states like Louisiana, where Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal told CNN in February that he'd be open to the ""tightly regulated"" use of medical marijuana. ""If you look at public opinion polls, support for legalizing medical marijuana is over 70% nationally, even in the South,"" Nadelmann said.

5134769e9d329129e9ff664ce0c47b9303a92bcc,"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- A jailed Italian mobster claims he can prove American student Amanda Knox, her former boyfriend and a drifter are innocent of murdering Knox's British roommate because he knows who the real killer is -- his brother. Luciano Aviello, 41, made the statement during a videotaped interview with Knox's lawyers. He said he had tried to write the Italian court several times to say that Knox and the others were innocent, but no one ever contacted him, defense and prosecution officials said. A source close to the case tells CNN that Aviello, who has been in and out of prison since age 17, was out of prison, living down the street from Knox and Meredith Kercher and under a ""protection program"" at the time of the murder. Aviello is serving 17 years in an Italian prison because of his association with the Camorra crime family. According to Italian media reports and Britain's Daily Mail, he has testified against the mob at several trials, always from behind a screen to shield his identity. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, were found guilty in December 2009 of Kercher's murder and are serving sentences of 26 and 25 years, respectively. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, plead guilty to the murder and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. In March, Aviello contacted Knox's attorneys, who visited him in prison to learn more about his story. Aviello told Knox's lawyers during the videotaped interviews that his brother, who was staying with him at the time of Kercher's murder, came home one night and said he had killed a girl during a botched robbery. British and Italian media have reported the brother's whereabouts are unknown and neither the lawyers for Knox nor the prosecution would comment further.

The Times wrote that Obama tested the limits of ""funeral etiquette"" (despite the memorial not being a funeral) with the self-portrait. Although they may have been acting less than gracefully at the moment the snap was taken, they did seem to be enjoying each other's company and Thorning-Schmidt just couldn't resist the urge to document the moment for herself.

Some Danes are bemused by the global reaction to the selfie -- as it hasn't hit their front pages yet -- perhaps reflecting a more laid-back approach in general, as was displayed by their PM in Johannesburg.

The victim's parents have been notified, police said, but his body has not been formally identified and so authorities are not releasing his identify. The stunt show has been touring since 1991. It features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes.

The group behind the project said it is a 'tremendously exciting discovery' which challenges the accepted history of the ancient dyke. The Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust excavations were . carried out on a stretch of the dyke along the Shropshire border near . the town of Chirk. Paul Belford, director of the  Archaeological Trust, said: 'It's been known as Offa's Dyke for centuries but some sections may not have been built by Offa. 'It may be a bit late to change the name now - although it raises some interesting questions.' The dyke, an Anglo-Saxon earthwork up to 65ft wide in places, was built as a man-made border between England and Wales. It was built by Offa of Mercia, who came to the throne in 757 after the murder of his cousin Ethelbald. He ruled the area now know as the Midlands and historians say he was the most powerful Saxon ruler before Alfred the Great. Today it is a protected monument and The Offa's Dyke Path is one of Britain's longest walks - stretching rom Prestatyn in North Wales down to Chepstow in the South.

The group was broken into two groups and took part in the same exercises - only one group was offered a financial reward for certain behavior, and the other wasn't. In one exercise, the students were presented with unethical acts and asked how likely they were to engage in the acts - one group for money, and one group for nothing. In another, they played a 'deception game,' in which one group could earn more money by lying rather than telling the truth, and the other would gain nothing from the lies. A third game allowed the students to choose to hire an employee who would share insider information if hired, and for the second group the candidate had no inside knowledge.

""Though only some 12% of Nevadans are Mormons, they punch more than their weight. Less than half the state's eligible voters bother to register, but Mormons almost always do, which gives them about a quarter of the likely turnout."" Members of the Jesus Christ Church of Latter Day Saints still punch more than their weight in Nevada politics, holding a broad array of elected offices and deep sway within the business community. But the portrait of Nevada as a sparsely populated desert locale where elections hinge on the Mormon vote now seems quaint. The state's dramatic population growth over the last two decades -- two-thirds of all registered voters in Nevada registered to vote after the 2000 presidential election, for instance -- has diluted the influence of Mormon voters on statewide elections. Nevada had just 375,000 registered voters in 1998 when Reid won his first Senate race. Now, more than a million voters are on the books. There are nearly 700,000 voters in Clark County alone. At the same time the state's population was exploding, Nevada's Mormon population slipped from 12% in 1986 to an estimated 7% today.

When pressed during an interview in her Tel Aviv home, Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has directed the use of any chemical weapons. But she said this development poses a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria. Livni told CNN that ""the appearance is that it's not going to be only in Syria, but that Hezbollah can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against Israel in the future."" Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the Assad regime is further destabilized. President Obama just landed in Israel for a two-day trip, and two national security issues dominate the agenda: the nuclear showdown with Iran and the growing crisis with Syria. On both fronts, Livni says, U.S. leadership can make the crucial difference. ""The United States has the tools in order to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon and in order to stop all this situation in Syria,"" she said, and she insisted that this is the time to act. ""It is not a favor to the state of Israel. This is something that represents the interests of the United States as well,"" she said. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks . In February, Israel attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. That assault did not involve chemical weapons, but clearly their use would increase the stakes for Israel.

A natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean is responsible for the slowdown in the pace of global warming so far this century, according to a new study. Scientists believe a series of naturally . occurring La Nina weather events in the Pacific in recent years, which . bring cooler waters to the surface, have masked the heat-trapping . effect caused by greenhouse gases. The slowdown has raised hopes among some governments that it will be easier and cheaper to achieve long-term goals for limiting temperature rises to avert more heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Strong currents in the Pacific Ocean have brought cooler water to the surface, slowing the pace of global warming, scientists believe . 'Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La Nina-like decadal cooling,' according to the study by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie at the University of California, San Diego. 'Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase,' they wrote in the journal Nature. Past studies have linked the slowdown in the pace of warming this century to factors such as a build-up of sun-dimming air pollution in the atmosphere or a decline in the sun's output. Others suggest that the deep oceans may be absorbing more heat. Nine of the 10 warmest years since records began in the mid-19th century have been since 2000, with 1998 the exception, according to U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Even so, the pace of warming has slowed from the 1980s and 1990s even though greenhouse gas emissions have hit record highs. There have been four years with La Nina cooling events in the Pacific since 1998 and only two with the opposite, El Nino, when the Pacific waters warm, according to WMO data.

And now, her husband is speaking up, saying ""she's strong and working out."" Rove, the mastermind behind George W. Bush's two presidential election victories, appeared at a conference last week, where he discussed a 2012 incident that sent the then-secretary of state to the hospital, according to the New York Post's Page Six gossip column. ""Thirty days in the hospital?"" asked Rove, a Fox News Channel contributor, according to the report. ""And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that."" Clinton, who's seriously considering a second bid for the White House, suffered a blood clot in December 2012, after falling. After first going to the hospital for testing, Clinton later was admitted for a three-day stay at a hospital in New York. The incident prevented her from testifying before Congress about the deadly 2012 terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, raising questions from some Republicans. She eventually appeared before lawmakers in January 2013. Should Clinton, 66, decide to seek the presidency, her health likely would be raised in the same context as any other candidate. Clinton: No need for new Benghazi committee, but GOP 'calls the shots' in the House . Democrats and others were quick to slam Rove. The Democratic National Committee put out a statement saying, ""It appears Karl Rove's medical diagnoses are about as solid as his election night prognostications.""

The 2-year-old child the worker was referring to has delayed speech development, and is pictured sitting in a high chair, looking dejected. Melissa Jordan says the photo shows her son, Ethan. Speaking Tuesday to CNN's ""New Day,"" she had a message for the day care workers: ""If you don't genuinely love and care for children, and if it's not a passion of yours, this isn't something that you should be involved in.

The treatment is already having ‘spectacular’ effects in seriously ill melanoma patients – and could soon be used to defeat other types of cancer. One scientist said it was ‘amazing’ that researchers could talk  of ‘using the C-word – cure’ for the first time, while another said trials among kidney and lung cancer patients are ‘very exciting’. Each year almost 13,000 people in Britain are diagnosed with melanoma, including two people aged 15 to 34 every day . One in six patients ravaged by deadly skin cancer are already being cured by the drugs, the European Cancer Congress was told yesterday, with the possibility of more than half being saved with an new combination. The astonishing development will save  the lives of thousands of patients with advanced melanoma, who usually die within months of being diagnosed. The new treatment, which will bring hope to  hundreds of thousands of people in Britain with terminal conditions, involves the combination of two  different types of drug that ‘reboot’ the immune system. The first is ipilimumab – or ‘ipi’. According to research presented to the European congress in Amsterdam yesterday, 17 per cent of patients are cured by this drug alone. But many more – perhaps more than half – could be ‘clinically cured’ by combining them with even newer drugs called anti-PD1s which break down cancer cells’ defences. Professor Alexander Eggermont of the Institut Gustave Roussy in France said: ‘[Advanced] melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 per cent of patients within five to 10 years.’ He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If I’d made this bizarre prediction five years ago, people would have said I was mad.

3e90538e055b825f62b0bc687faa4a577bc96eeb,"(CNN) -- Greece is hoping a derelict airport on the outskirts of Athens -- one which has sparked a keen contest among international investors -- will help solve its debt woes. Hellinikon airport, the sale of which initially piqued the interest of U.S. business tycoon Donald Trump, could be vital to reversing the fortunes of the Greek economy. Greece is awaiting a financial lifeline of 31.5 billion euros [$40.3 billion] from international creditors, following the approval of a 13.5 billion euro austerity package by Greek lawmakers earlier this month. Alongside aid packages and austerity measures, Greece is selling off assets from gas reserves to sewage works as it tries to gain control of its 340 billion euro pile of debt. And while the potential sale of Greece's coveted islands caught early -- and controversial -- headlines, hopes are now resting on the dilapidated airport as a potential economic savior. Four property developers -- Elbit Cochin Island Ltd, Lamda Development, London and Regional Properties and Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment -- have been shortlisted by the Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund (HRADF) to win exclusive rights to the site. The bidders did not respond or were unavailable for immediate comment. A fund spokesman declined to disclose the airport's potential purchase price but says redeveloping the land will cost around 6 billion euros. The fund has projected a redevelopment of the site will bolster Greece's gross domestic product, which has contracted by 39.5 billion euros in the past five years to 171.4 billion euros, by 0.3% over the next ten years. Greece's vast, derelict, symbol of hope . Hellinikon airport was once Greece's flagship terminal and hub for international travel, but has been abandoned since its closure in 2001. It stretches across 6.2 million square meters -- making it roughly twice as big as New York's Central Park -- and it represents a huge commercial project for investors.

An amateur beekeeper with a 6-year-old son has died after what appears to be a fatal allergic reaction to 40 stings. April Taylor was wearing gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family's back yard in Willard, Utah. Those precautions did not cover her entirely, however, as many beekeepers regularly wear full suits and high boots to insure that they are entirely covered when they interact with the insects. Mrs Taylor, 31, came into her house on Tuesday May 13 and showed her husband Zac how she had been stung 30 or 40 times. He told the Deseret News that she said she seemed fine but later that day she went back outside and he found her passed out. She was rushed to the local hospital but died three days later at Ogden Regional Medical Center. 'We all started thinking, ""Well, how did this happen? … Killer bees or what? But I guess after she had got stung, her husband called the beekeeper, and he came and figured out there was no queen bee in the hive,""' Zak Taylor's uncle Bruce Vail told the paper. 'He said if there's no queen bee in the hive, they get really protective of their hive and they just swarmed her.' According to her Facebook page, Mrs Taylor also suffered from multiple sclerosis. Hobby: Mrs Taylor, seen with her husband of 11 years Zak Taylor, was a hairdresser by trade but kept bees in her backyard . Tragic: The couple has a 6-year-old son named Lux (pictured with his face blurred because of his age) 'Just a free spirit, nice girl, good mother,' Mr Vail said. 'They just swarmed her, it was a freak thing.' Agriculture officials are investigating the incident, and have not yet been able to determine if it was an official attack.

Big Day Out fans are mourning the loss of one of the most highly anticipated music festivals after organisers announced the annual event won't be back in Australia or New Zealand next year. 'While we intend to bring back the festival in future years, we can confirm there will not be a Big Day Out in 2015,' American owners of the event, C3 Presents, confirmed on Thursday in a statement. The first inkling that the festival hit financial troubles came after promoters said earlier this year the event wouldn't return to Perth in 2015 after poor ticket sales. Rumours of this year's poor attendance figures and a court dispute between C3 and its former owner AJ Maddah was also reported by Fairfax Media earlier this year. Maddah later said the Big Day Out was cancelled because of a shortage of headline acts, when a Twitter follower asked him: 'is there a shortage of headliners at the moment? Every O/S festival i see headlined by Outkast'. 'Yes. There's a shortage of headliners on cycle this year. Hence BDO taking year off,' he replied. The music event has been on the calendar for Australians since 1992 when grunge rockers Nirvana played on the first bill alongside the American rock band Violent Femmes and Aussie outfit You Am I. Other headlining acts over the years include Iggy Pop, Marilyn Manson, Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Ramones, Angus and Julia Stone, The Beastie Boys, Neil Young, M.I.A, Lily Allen, Muse, Pearl Jam and Kanye West.

The Englishman blew away overnight leader Miguel Angel Jimenez with six birdies and only one dropped shot in 14 holes to take his tally to 13-under-par for the tournament. But a huge thunder and lightning storm meant the early abandonment of play and forced tournament organisers to contemplate the possibility of a reduced format in the penultimate event of the European Tour season. Ian Poulter tees off on the fifth hole at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal on his way to grabbing the lead . With more storms expected on Saturday, there is a race to conclude the second and third rounds in the space of a day, though on current form that is unlikely to disrupt Poulter. The 39-year-old, who was five under for the day when he was called off, continues to thrive after the equipment change made in the wake of a disappointing Ryder Cup. His mediocre Cup showing was the latest lowpoint in a year dominated by injuries and poor form, which saw him slide from 12th to 44th in the rankings – leaving him at risk of his lowest year-end ranking since September 2006. Ryder Cup star Victor Dubuisson was spotted with tissue stuffed up his nose to stem the flow of a nosebleed . The enigmatic Frenchman made for an unusual sight as he was forced to play with the tissue up his nostril . But having finished sixth in China last week, he has used a dusted-off old putter from two years ago to open up a three-shot lead over Brendon de Jonge. His putting has been impressive this week, but his scorching form on the par fives has made the difference, with nine shots gained from the nine long holes he’s played so far. Poulter, who on Thursday reflected on a ‘****’ season in which ‘there was no good’, said on Friday: ‘I’m playing great and to be on the top of the leaderboard is always nice.

Alex Song is now the club’s main man and he has the rest of the team dancing to his tune. Signing Song on loan was one of the most astute transfers of the summer. Plenty of Arsenal fans will be looking at him and asking: ‘Why isn’t he doing that job in our midfield?’ They have a point. Sam Allardyce saw a good opportunity and grabbed it. West Ham midfielder Alex Song is now stronger and more disciplined . After my final season at Arsenal I was invited back by the club to act as a mentor and was there when Song arrived. He was only 17 but he went straight into training with the first-team group. Along with Abou Diaby, he was earmarked as a potential successor to Patrick Vieira. Song’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work and Arsene Wenger is one of the best at developing young players. The focus with Song was always passing. Wenger likes midfielders to open up their body and receive the ball on the half-turn, giving them the chance to glance over their shoulder before receiving the ball to feet.

Along with Abou Diaby, Song was earmarked as a potential successor to Patrick Vieira (right) I watched Song work to improve for hours with Boro Primorac, Wenger’s right-hand man and a real technician. He’d do extra drills between two backboards, passing the ball to himself and learning to open up his body. If you can keep a good body shape in midfield you can open up the whole game. Now West Ham are reaping the benefits. He can receive the ball with one foot and pass with the other, which helps him see the bigger picture very early. He rarely takes more than two touches and that gets West Ham moving quickly. He is an excellent passer, too, a real side-foot specialist, so it’s no surprise West Ham average around 50 passes more per game this season compared to last.

After recovering full fitness, the 26-year-old started the FA Cup third-round tie against Hull and has retained his place in the league matches since, helping record clean sheets against Stoke, Manchester City and Aston Villa. David Ospina, pictured celebrating against Aston Villa, has replaced Wojciech Szczesny in goal for Arsenal . Szczesny played against Brighton in the FA Cup but conceded twice against the Championship side . Gunners boss Arsene Wenger says Szczesny - who was reported to have been smoking in the showers after the defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, where the Pole was culpable for the goals in a 2-0 defeat - is the Arsenal 'number one', but accepts Ospina has impressed with his performances. It remains to be seen whether Szczesny, who let in two in the FA Cup win at Brighton on January 25, is back between the posts for Saturday's north-London derby at Tottenham. Ospina, though, intends to do all he can to stake his claim. 'I see it as a big responsibility to come to a great club like Arsenal - it is a dream come true. Now it is my job to make the most of this opportunity that has come my way,' Ospina said on Arsenal Player. 'We have very good goalkeepers in the shape of Wojciech Szczesny and Emiliano Martinez.'

f72f6a2380350bb170d56036cd9bcdc8d667f1f7,"(CNN) -- Can anyone stop Bayern Munich? That's the question following the German side's 2-0 victory over Arsenal Wednesday in the last-16 of the Champions League. Already 16 points clear in the German Bundesliga and unbeaten in 21 league games, Bayern is looking like the team to beat once again. Bayern, which is hoping to become the first team to successfully defend the title since the competition was revamped in 1992, claimed a hard-fought win thanks to Toni Kroos' second half strike and Thomas Muller's header. It could and indeed should have been different but Arsenal wasted a glorious opportunity in the early stages when Mesut Ozil missed from the penalty spot. The home side's misery was compounded eight minutes before the break when goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off after bringing down Arjen Robben in the penalty area. David Alaba stood up to take the spot kick but could only strike his effort against the post. Bayern, which won 3-1 at Emirates Stadium at the same stage last season, began to lay siege to the Arsenal goal. And with nine minutes of the second half having elapsed, Kross unleashed a sumptuous strike which flew past substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The visitors refused to let up in their pressure and Robben had an effort well saved when his shot appeared destined for the far corner. Pep Guardiola's side did finally secure the second goal it so badly craved when substitute Muller headed home Philipp Lahm's cross with three minutes of normal time remaining. There was still time for Kroos, who scored in the game between the clubs last season, to hit the post with a measured drive. Arsenal will now head to Munich on March 11 with hopes of pulling off a repeat of their 2-0 victory last season. The same result would give Arsene Wenger's men the opportunity to take the tie into extra-time but it faces an uphill struggle against a rampant Bayern. ""We started really well and deserved one goal,"" Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker told Sky Sports. ",Bayern Munich beats Arsenal 2-0 in Champions League last-16 tie.

77be1e2afe7448516432cd228f7f3974d0dce6c1,"(CNN) -- In the white sand beaches of Yoff, the small fishing town just north of the Senegalese capital Dakar, a seemingly endless line of brightly colored boats dots the Atlantic seaside. It was here, about four years ago, that Spanish designer Ramon Llonch was first struck by the mysterious symbols and intricate patterns adorning the hand-painted wooden vessels. ""I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned,"" remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country. ""I was captivated by that colorful mosaic of life with the women selling the fish and the men approaching the shore,"" he adds. Read this: African firm invests billions in U.S. Looking at the old, weathered canoes, Llonch started wondering whether he could find a new use for them while preserving the history of their owners. His idea was to work with skillful local craftsmen and breathe new life into the traditional ""pirogues"" by transforming them into hand-made furniture. And that's how Artlantique was born, a company repurposing boats that are no longer sea worthy into upcycled fittings -- anything from whimsical chairs and coffee tables to one-of-a-kind cabinets and even foosball tables. ""It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa,"" says Llonch.

From the waters off the coast of Senegal, through the Dakar-based workshop, to several stores across the world, the journey of transforming the old fishing boats into furniture is far from easy.

A Cornell University student has made a series of painful conclusions in his research into stings by letting honey bees attack his own body. Michael Smith subjected himself to several stings a day to his face, arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs. After weeks of research Smith found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable, the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril. Science of stings: Cornell student Michael Smith researched the most painful places for a bee to attack . His usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser. 'We speculated it probably really would . hurt to get stung in the testicles. Two days later, by . chance, I did get stung there. It didn't hurt as much as I expected it . to,' he told the Independent. Smith measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful: . 1) Nostril  - 9.0             6) Cheek - 7.0 . 2) Upper lip - 8.7          7) Armpit - 6.7 . 3) Penis - 7.3               8) Nipple - 6.7 . 4) Scrotum - 7.0              9) Middle finger tip - 6.7 . 5) Palm - 7.0               10) Abdomen - 6.7 . Intrigued by his 'eureka' moment, Smith chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain. He then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him. Like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so, over the course of 38 days, he administered five stings a day. Each body part was stung three times during the experiment, and the pain level was given a mark out of 10. Because the experiment needed a control, he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day's research.

Chicago archbishops are usually elevated to cardinal and are therefore eligible to vote for the next pope. George is especially admired in the church's conservative wing as an intellectual who took a hard line against abortion and gay marriage. Francis has said he wants church leaders to focus more on mercy and compassion and less on hot-button issues. At a Chicago news conference Saturday, Cupich pledged to consult with local Catholics as he leads them.

Smith was not charged and said the tattoo has never been a problem before. Smith has multiple tattoos, including several covering his left arm. 'Obviously it was a misunderstanding and he didn't have a weapon, but we had to respond to the initial report as if he did,' Maine State police trooper Scott Duff told the Morning Sentinel. Smith, who works nights, said it sounded like someone was driving up his driveway and crushing a thick layer of ice on it. He went outside to tell the crew to leave his property, and they told him no problem. But one worker said he thought he noticed a pistol in Smith's waistband. Duff said he didn't think Smith went outside with his shirt off deliberately to make it appear he was carrying a gun. 'I got plans today. I didn't want to get shot,' Smith told the Morning Sentinel.

Your real prize -- the most valuable and sustaining award of all -- may not become evident to you until 30 or so years have passed. You will be much older. But -- if you are lucky -- you will still get to be out on the road making music. Many of Sunday's Grammy nominees are enjoying the first wave of big success. It is understandable if they take for granted the packed concert venues and eye-popping paychecks. Those may go away -- the newness of fame, the sold-out houses, the big money. But the joy of being allowed to do what they do will go on. I've been doing some work while staying at a small hotel off a highway in southwestern Florida. One winter day I was reading out on the pool deck, and there were some other people sitting around talking. They weren't young, by anyone's definition. They did not seem like conventional businessmen or businesswomen on the road, or like retirees. There was a sense of nascent energy and contented anticipation in their bearing, of something good waiting for them straight ahead. A look completely devoid of grimness or fretfulness, an afternoon look that said the best part of the day was still to come. I would almost have bet what line of work they were in. I'd seen that look before, many times. I could hear them talking. Yep. The Tokens (""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" a No. 1 hit in 1961). Little Peggy March (""I Will Follow Him,"" a No. 1 hit in 1963). Little Anthony and the Imperials (""Tears on My Pillow,"" a top 10 hit in 1958). Major singing stars from an earlier era of popular music, in town for a multi-act show that evening.

I got the vibe midweek. So I asked my friends on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, hardy survivors of Hurricane Katrina, what advice they would share with those in Hurricane Sandy's path. But I didn't want the usual flashlight, batteries, water, generator, gasoline tips. Tell them something they don't know, I asked, something that helped get you through. Here's what they said: . • Outdoor solar lights can be brought in at night to light the indoors. • When you make a video of your home for insurance purposes beforehand, open drawers and closets so the contents are visible. • Have a tire plug repair kit and pliers to pull out nails or screws, since debris in the roadway causes flats and leaks that are tough to repair when everything is closed. • Extend your cell phone battery's life by texting instead of calling and turning off Internet/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/GPS connections. • Bank safes and safe deposit boxes are not waterproof. During flooding, items left in them may be damaged and not accessible for weeks. • Have thick tarps and roofing tacks in case you lose shingles from the wind. What I didn't expect was the advice of a different nature that many added after their practical tips: . • Faith and the knowledge that no matter what, your life and the life of your family is more important than any material possession you may have. • Keep a positive attitude and help your neighbor! • Remember to have patience with your family, friends and neighbors. ... Work together and share your resources. • Talk to each other. Share old stories.

Police arrested him Monday after a call he made to Apple tech support using the computer's serial number led police to him. But wasn't an overnight success for owner Michael Witonis . A New Hampshire man whose Mac laptop was swiped from his home while he slept in 2013 may soon finally get it back all because the alleged thief called Apple tech support. But the call was made nearly a year ago and it's taken since then for Michael Witonis to convince Apple to give police the dirt they have on suspect Casey Wentworth. Witonis says he finally got them to hand over their records by tweeting at CEO Tim Cook. The Dover mechanical engineer's aggravating saga started in February 2013 when someone came into his home and took his MacBook Air, just months after he'd purchased the pricey computer. He's chalked it up as a loss until a few months later when Apple support emailed him regarding a support call made in regards to a computer with the serial number of the one he'd had stolen. Apple representatives informed him that they could only give their information to police. 'That was the start of an eight-month battle with Apple to get the information from them,' Witonis told ABCNews.com. He requests to have them turn the info over to police were met with scripted responses about an internal procedure they have in place for such issues. But the information stayed put even after Witonis obtained subpoenas. So Witonis decided to take his grievance to Apple's CEO himself via social media.

d27f9d1721a93ac94f54ecb64a7344d5ccbefb4c,"(CNN) -- At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man. It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children, a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004. Since that time, three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire, including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution. Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks, just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations. The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992. ""I don't sleep at night because of a lot of this,"" Brokofsky said. ""I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed. I don't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake, that the facts aren't what they could've been."" Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home. She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana, Texas, where the fire took place. ""I do have doubts now,"" she said. ""I mean, we can only go with what we knew at the time, but I don't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true. It may not be true now. And I don't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did."" ""When you're sitting there with all those facts, there was nothing else we could see,"" she said. ""Now I don't know. I can't tell you he's innocent, I can't say 100 percent he's guilty."" Brokofsky had another revelation. She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family's close relationship with key witness and then-Corsica","Dorenda Brokofsky was on the jury that convicted Cameron Todd Willingham.

786eb472fc6d5075258e995a72dfa54c7b248ec2,"Washington (CNN) -- Behind-the-scenes dealing over reviving stalled gun control legislation will get a push next week when Sen. Joe Manchin, a strong proponent of expanding background checks, plans to meet individually with lawmakers, a Senate source tells CNN. The key question the conservative West Virginia Democrat wants answered is whether a ""minimal change"" to a compromise background check proposal that he co-authored but which failed to gain enough support in a vote last month would entice more senators to support it, the source said. Since the proposal he negotiated with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania faltered, senators who voted against it have been hounded in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has been the most high-profile target of such confrontations. The New Hampshire Republican was questioned at an event by Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a school principal slain in the Newtown massacre last December. Lafferty asked ""why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't as important"" as inconveniencing gun sellers. Lafferty was sent to Ayotte's event by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of several gun control groups using the current congressional recess to take the gun control message out of Washington. And she followed that up with interviews with TV networks. The source said this sort of pressure from outside groups is a key to any hopes of swaying senators who may be open to supporting a modified proposal. In addition to confronting senators in person, groups have run ads against lawmakers who voted against the Toomey-Manchin compromise and have supported senators who supported it. The husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in Arizona, wrote an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle challenging the National Rifle Association over its opposition to expanded backgro","Sen.

029bcd7faefcaed0f597642b7340d83cb4509756,"(CNN) -- Myanmar is facing a food shortage largely due to last year's deadly Cyclone Nargis, which destroyed nearly all the rice crops in the fertile Ayeyarwaddy delta, the United Nations said Wednesday. A young farmer ploughs a field in preparation to grow rice in Dalla, about 20 kms south of Yangon on July 9, 2008. Rice production in the cyclone-affected areas of Ayeyarwaddy and Yangon, the largest city and former capital of Myanmar, is expected to be 50 percent of last year's, according to the report issued by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP). Rat infestation in western's Myanmar's Chin State has also contributed to the food shortage, the report says. ""Access to food remains the critical challenge for the poorest people and for vulnerable populations in remote areas of Myanmar,"" Chris Kaye, WFP's representative for Myanmar, said in a written statement. ""And for many of those affected by Cyclone Nargis, who are engaged in rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, the limited delta harvest means they will continue to rely on assistance to meet their food needs.""

Although rice production is expected to be adequate this year because of strong crops in other areas of the country, access to food remains a serious challenge to Myanmar's poor, especially in the delta region, the report said. More than 5 million people fall below the food poverty line and emergency food aid is still needed in cyclone-affected areas, the report said. The cyclone also hurt the cattle and fishing industries, contributing to the food crisis. ""Humanitarian assistance has not restored the production capacity of small to medium-sized farms,"" He Changchui, FAO's Asia-Pacific regional chief, said in a written statement.

A poignant 133-year-old letter has revealed details of the last stand of Australia's most famous outlaw, Ned Kelly, describing the moment bullets 'slid off him like hail' as he faced a bloody battle with police. In the first 'everyman' account of the Glenrowan Siege, a young bank teller named Donald Sutherland tells how he witnessed Kelly being captured and, in the letter to his parents in Scotland, details the shootout with police on June 28, 1880. The heavy homemade armour and helmet which protected Kelly during the battle helped make him an iconic figure in Australian history. But in scenes similar to Clint Eastwood's western, a Fistful of Dollars, the bullets seemed to have bounced off him. In the film Eastwood's character Joe enters a showdown with a steel chest-plate hidden beneath his poncho, as his opponent's rifle shots bounce off, allowing him to win the duel.

It's the Giant Flag of South Africa, and it's an ambitious project by almost any measure. Located in the Camdeboo Municipality of Karoo, an arid region between Cape Town and Johannesburg, it will transform a patch of desert into a living national flag spanning about 163 acres, the size of 66 soccer fields. Some 2.5 million red, yellow, blue and green desert plants, including cacti and spekboom, will be arranged in a pattern like that of South Africa's flag. The flag's black triangular area will contain a 4-megawatt solar-panel field, generating much-needed electricity for the region. The idea is simple and elegant: use green tourism to fight poverty. Guy Lieberman came up with the idea after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when the South Africans played host and were united by the spirit of their flag. His employer, FCB South Africa, a communications firm, asked him to come up with a legacy project related to the flag. It's about ""how we treat ourselves, nature, our built environment, and how we choose to view our common future on the planet,"" Lieberman said.

With the looming threat of climate change, this can only be a good thing. Meanwhile, the solar panels are expected to power the equivalent of 4,000 homes. Organizers hope to complete the flag in 2017. ""The Giant Flag aims for a blend of ecological balance and social stability. One could call this compassionate capitalism,"" Lieberman said.

A businessman whose car number plate read 'Who's bad' lost control on a country lane while showing off his sports car at 100mph and killed two married fathers, a court has heard. Property developer Darren Jarvis, 42, was driving friend Lee Williams in his white turbo-charged Nissan Skyline sports car when he lost control. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jarvis span across the road and crashed into a Citroen Xsara driven by Jacek Stawski. Mr Williams, 40, and 38-year-old Mr Stawksi - both married with two children - were killed 'almost instantly' in the horror smash in Cwmbach, south Wales, in August last year. But Mr Stawski's four-year-old-son Thomas miraculously survived in the back seat of the family car. Prosecutor Nicholas Jones said Jarvis was speeding at 100mph on a winding road to show off in the £30,000 3.8 litre turbo sports car. He said that although the car's number plate was WHO6 BAD, a screw had been put through the number six to make the registration read 'Who's bad' from a distance.

And, you know those little grooves in runways that channel away standing water? NASA again. America's space agency isn't just about space. It also develops ways to make our airliners safer and more efficient. Guess what? You may have been flying with NASA technology for years, and didn't even know it. Shape-shifting wings? They're coming . Now, an ongoing project could radically change the way airliners look and, more importantly, save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fuel costs. NASA calls it the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge project, or ACTE. It's best described in three words: Shape. Shifting. Wings. Those words sound like science fiction, but NASA and a company called Flexsys are developing wings that change shape in response to flight conditions and weather. Superflexible very strong composite materials make it possible. What does that mean to air travelers? You've probably looked out the window of an airliner to see the hinged metal flaps on the rear edge of a wing. New flexible materials allow the wing to change shapes without hinges. NASA shows off new flight technology . This week, NASA invited dozens of aerospace bloggers and social media mavens to see new aviation technology at its Armstrong Flight Research Center in California's High Desert, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. They got an exclusive look at NASA's flexible wing project and other ongoing research aimed at aviation. They also got a chance to hang out with engineers and pilots. Then, they tweeted about it. Project manager Tom Rigney compared the flexible wings to ""watching a bathtub bend. You don't expect something shaped like that to bend into a very fluid looking shape.""

Britain is frittering away tens of millions of pounds hiring an army of consultants to tell India how to run its own affairs. A Mail on Sunday investigation into contracts awarded to consultants has found that instead of money going directly to India’s poor and needy, much of it goes into the pockets of firms, some American, that are paid to hold meetings and produce reports. It hired a group of consultants - including one leading US university - to work on a £5 million deal to tell the Department for International Development whether it was wasting money. The UK Government insists it will continue to give the economic superpower £280 million a year until 2015 – despite India’s insistence that it does not want or need the money. The UK Government is spending millions of pounds hiring consultants across the world to tell India how to spend its money instead of giving it to those who need it most . The rapidly industrialising country, whose economy is ranked 11th in the world with a GDP of £1.85 trillion, is rich enough to run its own space programme and last month announced it would spend £52 million sending a probe to Mars next year.

ca25e0574414ed7cf0523cbf7411af7ea4b878d5,"(CNN) -- Verizon pulled a rabbit out of its corporate hat earlier this month. The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway. Verizon purchased these rights from Comcast and Time Warner, two large cable-TV companies, and the smaller Bright House Networks. Sound familiar? AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum. The AT&T deal drew the wrath of the Justice Department and the FCC. Indeed, it appears the current incarnation of the AT&T proposed merger is dying a slow death. U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle agreed on Monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing, and asked AT&T to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with T-Mobile. Does a similar fate await Verizon? Ah, you say, there's no real comparison. Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market. But the deals do have one big thing in common: In both, the primary objective is to cope with the looming scarcity of spectrum. For without more of it, neither carrier will be able to deliver on the promise of whizbang wireless services such as high definition movies any time, anywhere. To be sure, the problem here is not precisely a shortage of spectrum, but wasteful allocation of what's usable with the latest technology. If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses. That includes spectrum warehoused by government: In many cases, the repositioning of equipment or the purchase of up-to-date equipment would allow tasks ranging from public safety communication to weather forecasting to be done as well with less.

The important photograph, which dates from the 1850s, predates the modern craze by almost 200 years. It was discovered in a leather-bound book of 70 albumen prints by the renowned Swedish artist. This self-photograph of Oscar Rejlander  taken in the 1850s is believed to be the world's first ever 'selfie' When the owner approached Morphets auctioneers in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, they said they had no idea of the real value of the book. Liz Pepper Darling of Morphets said:  'The vendor brought the album into the office, and asked for it to be sold with a reserve of £100. 'We quickly realised it was quite an important album of early photographs, when the art was really in its infancy.' Among the sitters in the album are Rejlander's wife, Hallam Tennyson - the son of poet Lord Alfred Tennyson, and Rejlander himself. The first photographs were developed by French inventor Nicéphore Niépce who in 1824 creates the first permanent photograph. However the word photography was only first used in 1839 by Sir John Herschel after he created the first glass negative. The first Kodak camera was produced in 1888 allowing 'ordinary people to take photographs . Rejlander, who started out as a portrait painter before moving into photography, became well known for his photomontage print 'The Two Ways of Life'- made up of 32 negatives - which caused a scandal because of the partially nude subjects, although respectability came again when Queen Victoria bought a copy of the print for Prince Albert. Rejlander sold the album of 70 prints to 19th century naval hydrographer Captain George Browing, and it was passed down through the family to most recent owner, who the auctioneers said had no inkling of its significance. Although individual prints have come to market in the past, the album is thought to be the first work by Rjelander ever sold in public.","Photograph was discovered in a leather-bound book of 70 albumen prints by the renowned Swedish artist.

It is about 10 times older than any DNA ever recovered and comes from a fragment of the ancient animal’s foot that had been so remarkably preserved in permafrost scientists were able to extract blood proteins. Dating up to 780,000 years ago, the bone sheds fresh light on equine evolution and dramatically extends the known limit of DNA survival. Scientists extracted the DNA from two pieces of 700,000-year-old horse bone found in the frozen Yukon . Professor Ludovic Orlando, of Copenhagen University, and colleagues mapped the animal’s genes and compared them to another ancient horse from around 43,000 years ago as well as five contemporary breeds, the only surviving wild horse called a Przewalski and a donkey. State of the art DNA analysis techniques allowed them to sequence 73 proteins, including some found in the blood. The study, published in Nature, showed the Equus lineage that gave rise to all modern-day horses, donkeys and zebras originated around four million years ago - twice the conventionally accepted time. The genome - or complete DNA - is almost 10 times older than the previous record which was for an early human called a Denisovan that lived about 80,000 years ago. It shows horse populations have fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years particularly during times of severe climatic change.

The painting by Brett Murray entitled 'The Spear' has been on display since early this month, but made the news only last week when it came to the attention of South Africa's governing African National Congress party. X marks the spot: A protester is caught on CCTV defacing the controversial portrait of South African Jacob Zuma at a Johannesburg gallery . Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website. Both the gallery and the newspaper refused on the grounds it would be censorship. The matter was set to be heard today.

But increasingly, that's not the case. Investor and business commentator Paul Kedrosky recently vented his outrage at the pile of garbage he found on Google when he went looking for tips on buying a dishwasher. UC Berkeley professor (and tech commentator) Vivek Wadhwa threw up his hands when Google couldn't help his students find the information they were looking for. And at a panel on the future of search earlier this week, Loopt co-founder Sam Altman said: ""Three times in the last month, I searched for things on Google, and the result wasn't on the front page. That's the first time it's ever happened."" A major source of the problem is the entire industry that has emerged to game the Google system, producing content that looks promising within the results, but that when clicked on, serves up a mishmash of text that looks like sneezed-out alphabet soup. The material produced by Demand Media -- and other content farms, like AOL's Seed -- is usually not as egregious as the example above, but it's often not far behind. Demand and AOL both employ humans, but make thousands of assignments a month -- and there are minimum quality requirements. The payment structure at both companies is such that very few freelancers can afford to devote the time necessary to produce the kind of reliable take a reader might be looking for. For example, a Wired story about Demand described the efforts of a vide","Demand Media burst onto the public markets last month, earning itself a valuation of $1.5 billion.

Astronomers have spotted a giant river of hydrogen in space - and say it could be what gives spiral galaxies their ability to keep spewing out stars. They say it could give an unprecedented insight into how galaxies like our own Milky Way form new stars - and why some are far more productive than others. The groundbreaking discovery helps explain the mystery that had baffled astronomers. The bright star-filled central region of galaxy NGC 6946 is shown in blue, while the dense hydrogen tracing out the galaxy's sweeping spiral arms and galactic halo is orange, and the extremely diffuse and extended 'river' of hydrogen engulfing NGC 6946 and its companions is red . The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 . NGC 6946 is located approximately 22 million light-years from Earth on the border of the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus. It is an active galaxy, though less-so than more extreme starburst galaxies, researchers said. 'We knew that the fuel for star formation had to come from somewhere,' said astronomer D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University. 'So far, however, we’ve detected only about 10 percent of what would be necessary to explain what we observe in many galaxies.' 'A leading theory is that rivers of hydrogen – known as cold flows – may be ferrying hydrogen through intergalactic space, clandestinely fueling star formation. But this tenuous hydrogen has been simply too diffuse to detect, until now.' Using the National Science Foundation’s Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University has discovered what could be a never-before-seen river of hydrogen flowing through space. The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946. Spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, typically maintain a rather tranquil but steady pace of star formation.

PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 1 May 2012 . If your home is in Hartlepool, Newport, Sunderland or Newcastle upon Tyne, you should probably look away now. While house prices are plunging around Britain, particularly in these cities, there is one gold-plated corner of the capital where a garage is on the market for more than £500,000. Hidden in a tiny back street close to Harrods, the double garage does not look special from the outside. The garage on the little-known Rysbrack Street is painted black, but not that recently, and the brown brickwork around the garage has been blackened by dirt. Expensive: This garage, in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge, is on the market for £525,000 . But it has just been put on the market with the highest price tag ever charged for a garage by the estate agency WA Ellis, which was founded in 1868. At a record price of £525,000, the buyer could buy three of Britain’s ‘average’ homes, which currently cost £160,000 each, for the same price, and still have £45,000 left over in change. It is possible to swing a cat in the garage, but only just - it measures 6.4 metres wide and just 4.75 metres deep. Robert Lewis, an associate at W A Ellis, insists the garage is ‘exceptionally valuable’ because it is ‘very rare’ for a freehold garage in Knightsbridge to come up for sale. He said: ‘We anticipate interest from those already living within a two or three minute walk of the garage. 'For example, the large houses on Walton Place where there is no off-street parking.’ The garage was put up for sale a week after a  flat-roofed brick shed, in Highgate village, north London, went on the market for £259,950.

The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is ‘going nowhere’. The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant. The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which represents 2,000 charities, claims reforms designed to hand power from Whitehall to communities and good causes are moving ‘glacially slow’. Criticism of government reforms comes as Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg today launch a Mid-Term Review of the coalition’s progress and set out new policies for the next two and a half years. Mr Cameron had boasted that the Big Society was his ‘great passion’ but critics said it was vague and was being used as a cover for cuts to public services. Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed. Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded.

The action was a response to internal investigations of leadership lapses and misbehavior at two of its three intercontinental ballistic missile bases. The most senior officer to be relieved was Col.

Carl Jones (pictured left) was relieved from his duties in Wyoming, Col. Richard Pagliuco (pictured right) received administrative punishmen . He was dismissed 'for a loss of trust and confidence in his leadership abilities,' and has been reassigned as a special assistant to the wing commander. The actions on Monday were confirmed to The Associated Press in response to an AP inquiry about an internal Air Force investigation of two commanders at the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, which also is responsible for 150 Minuteman 3 missiles. A separate investigation was conducted at F.E. Warren. The Air Force nuclear missile corps has suffered a rash of recent setbacks, including the firing last year of its top commander and a number of security lapses. It is unusual for disciplinary action to be taken against senior officers at two of the Air Force's three nuclear missile bases on the same day. Officials said the timing was a coincidence. It extends a pattern of leadership failures in the ICBM force over the past year. Last March nine officers were fired at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, which is the third of the three nuclear missile bases, in response to an exam-cheating scandal there.

A man who served 17 years in prison after police tricked him into falsely confessing to murdering his parents has settled a wrongful conviction lawsuit against New York state for nearly $3.4million. Martin Tankleff, 42, was convicted in the 1988 killings of his parents in their eastern Long Island home. But he was freed in 2007 after an appeals court found key evidence in his trial was overlooked. Prosecutors ultimately decided against a new trial. His attorneys argued that his confession was coerced and that a family business associate was the real culprit. A spokeswoman for the state attorney general confirmed the settlement, saying it resolves the case on behalf of the state. Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were bludgeoned and stabbed. He told police he found them on September 7, 1988, in their waterfront home in Belle Terre. His mother was dead; his father was gravely wounded and died a few weeks later. The teenager suggested that a partner in his father's bagel business could be the killer. He said the partner owed Seymour Tankleff hundreds of thousands of dollars. The business partner, Jerry Steuerman, was never charged and has denied involvement in the crimes. After questioning Tankleff at home and at police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had awoken from a coma and named him as the killer. At that point, Tankleff wondered aloud whether he might have 'blacked out' and committed the crimes. Police said they read him his Miranda warning, but Tankleff waived his rights and confessed to attacking his parents.

76ad390fead2573b26e04fa79fcb6593748c76fa,"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has split from the management company which has helped him become one of the world's wealthiest sportsmen since he joined it at the start of his professional golf career back in 1996. The former top-ranked player announced on Monday that he will be staying with his longtime agent Mark Steinberg, who has left IMG after his contract expired. ""Staying with Mark Steinberg. Total confidence in him,"" Woods wrote on social networking website Twitter. ""Excited about the next stage in my professional life. Fond memories of Mark McCormack."" McCormack founded IMG, one of the world's leading sports management companies, but died in 2003. Sliding Tiger drops out of golf's top ten . Woods' endorsements have been handled by Steinberg since 1998, but the golfer's declining fortunes have reportedly led to his agent's departure from IMG. Woods has not won a tournament since the end of 2009, and the scandal about his marital infidelities that broke after that resulted in the loss of some lucrative sponsorship deals. The 35-year-old has dropped to 15th in the rankings, struggling this year with injuries, but he still earned $70 million in 2010 from his existing deals according to Golf Digest. Harmon expresses fears for Woods' career . Sports Business Journal and the New York Times both reported that Woods' reduced earnings meant that IMG could no longer afford Steinberg's salary. IMG has instead promoted Guy Kinnings and Robbie Henchman, its senior vice-presidents in Europe and Asia Pacific respectively, to be co-heads of its golf division. Woods is battling to be fit for this month's U.S. Open, a major tournament he has won three times, due to ongoing leg problems he suffered at the Masters in April.

Overlooking Hyde Park and occupying the 15th - 17th floors of the stunning and architecturally unique creation that is the Eliza building, the apartment boasts 3.8 metre high ceilings and even comes with a passenger lift for those who don't wish to take the stairs. Scroll down for video . The Eliza penthouse, which looks over Sydney's bustling CBD, is on the market for $15 million . There are four bedrooms and six bathrooms spread across the 499 square metre property, and also included in the skyhouse are a private lobby and huge open plan living areas, Property Observer reported. The top level of the penthouse is designed for entertaining, with a large terrace, an outdoor kitchen and an enormous infinity pool. The master bedroom boasts its own study area, as well as a walk-in-wardrobe and a dressing 'chamber'. The kitchen, with its limestone floors, marble benchtops and splashbacks has a 'fully-integrated' $50,000 fridge. For some that's more than the price of a brand new luxury vehicle or the deposit on a property. And apart from that the apartment is also home to a $350,000 marble staircase, a working fireplace and electronically-controlled curtains. All living and dining spaces - as well as at least one of the bathrooms - feature floor to ceiling glass giving way to breathtaking views of the city from many parts of the house.

In a new survey, one in four mothers and fathers admit they have felt forced by fellow parents to spend more than they felt necessary on birthday presents. Scroll down for video . Many parents actually agree with singer Myleene Klass, who last week said she felt under pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' presents for other people's children . The findings suggest that many parents share the negative view of Myleene about being asked to donate money towards a class collection for birthday gifts. One in eight of those polled said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, and of these, the majority (53 per cent) thought the request had been cheeky and that the child should be happy with what they received. Only a quarter of those questioned  (28 per cent) said they were happy to contribute to a group present if it meant the youngster got what they wanted. In terms of cost, more than a third were asked to contribute less than £10, while a further 42 per cent could choose how much to give. Classic FM presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails she received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents’ preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year' - a desk and a Kindle.

After drugging and handcuffing the wardens, they took their keys and unlocked all the prison's cells according to police chief Angelina de Andrades Ferreira. She told a news conference: 'The plan was to seduce them. They served them cheap whisky with some substance to knock them out, then unlocked the central gate which accesses the internal cells. 'Whoever wanted to escape left by the front door. From the moment they drank the whisky the agents don't remember a thing. 'One was found dizzy, trying to wake up.

A New York Times bestselling author, Moyo first grabbed international headlines with her 2009 book ""Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa."" Since then, she's penned two more books, on the subject of the decline of the West, and the effects of China's commodities rush. In a new interview with CNN's Robyn Curnow, Moyo explains why she's optimistic about the future of Africa. She looks at the positive impact that China can have on the continent and details the key drivers that will spur Africa's economic growth. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: The aid debate is so different from before ... Dambisa Moyo: So much has happened in the last five years -- whether you're in Africa, South America or Asia, nobody talks about aid anymore. Policy makers themselves are going out and issuing debts in the market. My own country, Zambia, did a fantastic bond, a $750 million 10-year bond, last September. The discussion is so much more about job creation and investment, which is such a fantastic story and it's obviously partly to do with the fact that the traditional donors are having a financial problem, fiscal problem, on their balance sheets. They just don't have the capital anymore to hand out cash like they did in the past. CNN: The Chinese story has been thrown into the mix, has that changed the landscape? DM: Yes, absolutely, but in a strange way it's exactly what we need in terms of delivering economic growth and meaningfully reducing poverty. We need jobs, we need investment, we need trade, we need foreign direct investment, whether investment domestically but also from the outside. It's not some magic pill, everybody knows that this is the formula, and finally the Chinese are showing up, again, not just in Africa, bu","Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo is an outspoken critic of international aid.

However, Sportsmail understands that one reason why chief executive Ed Woodward and fellow board members are giving Moyes so much time and patience is that they feel he inherited a set-up from Ferguson that was not fit for purpose at Barclays Premier League level. Nobody at the club wants publicly to sully Ferguson’s legacy, given that his 27-year reign lifted United from oblivion to the summit of European football. He also left Moyes a squad that had just won the league by 11 points.

None of the HIV vaccines tested so far have come close to providing adequate protection against the virus. About 34 million people are infected with HIV and although drugs are used to manage many cases, there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections . This is because of the challenges posed by the ‘envelope’ protein, which is called Env. Env’s structure is so complex and delicate scientists have found it difficult to get the protein into a form that is suitable for the imaging technique necessary to study it. Professor Andrew Ward, of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), explained: ‘It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it’s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable.’ In the study, researchers created a version of Env that has the stability and other properties needed for successful imaging, but that retains virtually all the structures found on Env. Using cutting-edge imaging methods they were then able to study the new Env in minute detail.

Microsoft has revealed that it keeps $92.9billion 'permanently reinvested outside the U.S.' - meaning it has not paid $29.6billion in taxes. The tech company said in a SEC filing 'As of June 30, 2014, we have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the U.S.' Microsoft noted that 'The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences was approximately $29.6 billion at June 30, 2014.' Those figures were first noted in a report by The International Business Times. Sheltered? Microsoft has said it keeps $92.9billion overseas . 'The amount of money that Microsoft is keeping offshore represents a significant spike from prior years, and the levies the company would owe amount to almost the entire two-year operating budget of the company’s home state of Washington,' the website reported. In June, a Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ) report indicated that Microsoft heavily relies on tax shelters. 'Microsoft reported operating 10 subsidiaries in tax havens in 2007 in 2013, it disclosed only five,' the report said. 'During this same time period, the company increased the amount of money it held offshore from $6.1 billion to $76.4 billion in U.S. taxes. That implies that the company pays a tax rate of just 3 percent to foreign governments on those profits, suggesting that most of the cash is booked to tax havens.' International: Microsoft reportedly employs locations in Ireland, Bermuda, Singapore, and Puerto Rico to help it avoid paying taxes, according to a Senate report.

Ron Dennis said after last Sunday’s Austrian Grand Prix that they were ‘not looking to finalise our driver line-up now’ — hardly a ringing endorsement of Button. Much depends on whether Alonso is ready to join McLaren at the start of their engine partnership with Honda, which begins for next season, or would rather see out the final year of his Ferrari contract before committing. It is understood McLaren would have no reluctance in signing Alonso despite the acrimonious year they spent together in 2007. Top target: Fernando Alonso is on McLaren's wish list . Their less favoured option is Hamilton, although he would only leave Mercedes if he loses out on the title to his team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Johnson is charged with first-degree misdemeanor domestic battery in the alleged head-butting last month of his new wife. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail, according to the Broward State Attorney's Office.

He played a preseason game the day before the incident, but had not participated in a regular season game with the team. No reason was given for his release. Johnson and Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show ""Basketball Wives,"" married on July 4. Their time together was to be featured in a new series on that network. Lozada files for divorce . That reality show, ""Ev and Ocho,"" was canceled shortly after the alleged head-butting, VH1 said on its website.

The federal flexibility will be allowed ""in exchange for state-developed plans to prepare all students for college and career, focus aid on the neediest students, and support effective teaching and leadership, "" according to the U.S. Department of Education. With the addition of eight news states, the Obama administration has approved 19 states so far, while 17 states and the District of Columbia are under review. U.S. Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced the latest waivers for Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island at an event in Hartford, Connecticut.

d71aba3430dc3bf4601d148ef97e3e6cfe4b309d,"(CNN) -- Saturday was all about Lionel Messi as the Barcelona striker scored for a record 17th consecutive game in Spain's La Liga but on Sunday Cristiano Ronaldo answered with two goals of his own to continue his remarkable streak for Real Madrid. The Portuguese striker grabbed both goals as Real won 2-1 at Celta Vigo which takes his record for the club to 188 goals in 186 games. Jose Mourinho's side have now won six games in a row, including twice against Barcelona and a decisive victory against Manchester United to take them into the last eight of the European Champions League. Despite their victory Real still sit 13 points behind runaway leaders Barca, and have their sights set on a cup double -- in Europe's top club competition and Spain's most prestigious cup tournament, the Copa del Rey. Real went close twice in the first half through France forward Karim Benzema, both chances supplied by Ronaldo, but he turned finisher on the hour mark when he turned and finished from close range after a deflection in the area. But Celta, who are deep in relegation trouble, pulled level just two minutes later when Iago Aspas' shot took a deflection off Portuguese defender Pepe and squirmed past Diego Lopez. Real restored their advantage when Celta goalkeeper Javi Varas brought down Brazil playmaker Kaka and Ronaldo stepped up to score his 25th league goal of the season -- 15 behind Messi's league tally. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain missed a glorious chance to put the game beyond doubt when he somehow contrived to miss from six yards out after a perfect center from Germany international Mesut Ozil. And Real were nearly made to pay as Celta's on loan Arsenal forward Park Chu-Young, from South Korea, headed against the crossbar late in the game.

Cave last year claimed his 'face doesn't fit' with the Ireland set-up, while Eoin Griffin left Connacht for London Irish in the summer, frustrated by his lack of national chances.

After three years in retirement, Schumacher returned to F1 with the new Mercedes team, but has struggled to make an impact on the race track, finishing this year's season in a disappointing ninth place. It has led many to wonder why the racing legend has returned to sport. But amid the gossip and allegations, the 41-year-old has defended his decision. He told CNN: ""I enjoy it. I feel I have the right to do what I enjoy. Whether I put in dispute my reputation...I just feel good about my decision and I have so much support from people."" ""I certainly want to make it a successful return,"" he continued. ""I'm only happy if I'm back on the winning road with the team. This is what I'm working for, this is the joy of the passion for Formula 1."" His decision has been supported by some of the biggest names in F1. Finnish F1 driver for Team Lotus Heikki Kovalainen told CNN the criticisms towards Schumacher were unfair. ""People had high expectations, people expected him to win. But (Mercedes) didn't have a car to win and second of all, things have changed since he left Formula 1."" Fellow F1 champion Alain Prost said no-one should judge or criticize a driver of his caliber, saying, ""For me, it is difficult, almost impossible to go back to the title after three years...But if there's one driver who'd be able to do it, I think it's Michael."" Team principal and co-owner of Mercedes, Ross Brawn, admits the team has had a disappointing year and credits some of that to Schumacher. ""It's been disappointing, in overall performance, we haven't had the car, Michael's taken a little time to get up to the performance he'll be able to deliver. I've seen patches of that performance...the last few races of the season was the Michael Schumacher I expected to see.

She then moved in with her grandparents who are now paying for the lawyer who is suing their own son Michael - Caitlyn's father.

3c3525cd549626cab6bd9c33c1c32050631d1b8e,"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called a high-level judiciary meeting to discuss the case of a rape victim who was jailed because of the attack and has agreed to marry the rapist to get out of prison and legitimize her daughter, the president's spokesman said Monday. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Kabul, was called in reaction to a petition with nearly 5,000 signatures and media inquiries about the case, said Karzai spokesman Aimal Faizi. The woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she approached authorities to report that her cousin's husband had raped her two years ago. CNN is identifying her only as Gulnaz to protect her identity. She did not immediately report the attack, fearing reprisals from elements of Afghanistan's conservative society and was sentenced to prison for adultery because her attacker was married at the time. Her sentence was later reduced to three years. A spokesman for the attorney general, Rahmatullah Naziri, told CNN last week that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced, she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense. She is now raising her daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter. She also fears attack from her rapist's relatives, something he denies is a risk. Kim Motley, a lawyer for 21-year-old Gulnaz, said the petition gathered 4,751 names in about 48 hours. The palace received the petition on Sunday, she said. It comes with an official plea for clemency addressed to the president, who has the power to immediately pardon Gulnaz. Her plight gained international attention when the European Union blocked the broadcast of a documentary made about her ordeal saying that it would further jeopardize her safety. The U.S. State Department, while not explicitly calling for Gulnaz's release, said Thursday that ""Gulnaz's situation is one no woman should have to face"" and called on ","Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called a high-level judiciary meeting.

The United States has developed its own laser technology, with a prototype weapon fitted to a naval vessel to target drones and small aircraft. According to Chinese officials, their new system can shoot down a rogue drone within five seconds of detecting its target.

A health aide to a man with Down syndrome who died after being dragged from a Maryland theater had warned police that he would ‘freak out’ if they touched or spoke to him, according to an investigative file released Monday.

The 98-page incident report and handwritten statements from 22 witnesses add new details to a case that remains in the spotlight six months after Saylor's death on January 12. Critics continue to call for an independent investigation of the deputies' actions after a grand jury's decision in March not to indict them for what the state medical examiner's office has ruled a homicide. The 18-year-old caretaker, whose name is redacted from the documents, wrote that she had been Saylor's aide for three months before he died. She said Saylor, known to his family as Ethan, had a history of angry outbursts, including one earlier that night. They had already seen the movie once and were outside the Frederick theater when she asked Saylor if he was ready to go home. Saylor began cursing and punched a Lenscrafters storefront window, she told police. Somewhat frightened, the caretaker called Saylor's mother, 55-year-old Patti Saylor, of New Market. ‘Patti told her to just wait him out and his attitude will change,’ an investigator wrote in a follow-up interview report.

Vaccinations and medications provide an effective form of response in the face of an outbreak. But avoiding social activity and staying at home can help halt the spread of infectious diseases, scientists have said. Scroll down for video . Simple measures such as staying at home during a flu pandemic can help halt spread of the virus, scientists have today revealed . A new study by a team of scientists at the University of California, Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Yale University found these non-pharmaceutical interventions can prove effective. Whether privately initiated or policy directed, actions calling for the closure of schools and entertainment venues, and cancelling public events are becoming more relevant in control strategies. Lead author of the study economist Michael Springborn, from the Univeristy of California, said: The swine flu outbreak that hit Mexico City in April 2009 could have been worse, but spread of the virus was reduced by people's behavioural response of distancing themselves from each other.' The researchers created a a new model that incorporates behavioural responses into existing models of disease spread. In April 2009 in Mexico, following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, or swine flu, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place. Researchers looked at television viewing in the home in Central Mexico as an indicator of behavioural response, during the pandemic. Professor Springborn said television ratings are consistently and widely available and 'highly correlate' with time spent in the home. The data provides a good indicator for the level of social interaction, with time spent watching TV increasing with the amount of time spent in the home.

The operatives are key members of Khorasan Group, the al Qaeda affiliate entrenched in Syria that the United States has declared poses a great risk to American national security.  One official with direct knowledge of the latest U.S. assessment said the working assumption now is that both Muhsin al-Fadhli, the leader of the group, and David Drugeon, a French jihadist and key member, who is believed to be a skilled bomb-maker, are alive. The United States does not know with certainty if they are injured. An intelligence analyst with knowledge of the intelligence tells CNN ""its 99.5% certain"" they are alive. There had been scattered press reports about the fate of both men. But until now the United States had not indicated this strongly that it believes both men survived or left before a barrage of 47 U.S. Navy Tomahawk missiles on September 22 on several suspected Khorasan sites in Syria. Officials said news reports on Khorasan Group before the strikes may have had an impact on the effectiveness of striking the group. Drugeon is believed to be heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe. His name has not been widely disclosed by the United States. Like al-Fadhli and the rest of the Khorasan Group, U.S. officials say Drugeon has ties to the core al Qaeda group in Pakistan and is believed to have come to Syria from Pakistan in the last two years. U.S. officials said he is believed to be one of the key bomb-makers in the group and may have been actively involved with creating easily concealed bombs that led to increased security measures at overseas airports this past summer.

""After that, depending on the results, we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action."" Has Semenya been treated fairly? The IAAF issued a statement, saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results. A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco, the IAAF said. Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution.

ea3f025144fae5bb81af876d13bf6cbca01caeab,"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities on Friday seized radioactive material from the luggage of a passenger on a flight from Moscow to Tehran, Iran. The luggage, belonging to an Iranian citizen, contained 18 metal objects packed in individual steel cases, Russia's Federal Customs Service said. The agency said the material, the radioactive isotope Sodium-22, can be obtained in a nuclear reactor. The news sparked concern that the incident may have been related to Iran's nuclear program, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last month could be geared to produce weapons. Iran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Nuclear expert Michael Friedlander said Sodium-22 has no applications related to weapons. It is generally used to calibrate nuclear instruments in medical equipment, he said. Initial tests showed that radiation levels of the objects were 20 times above normal, the Russian customs service said. Radiation expert Paddy Regan, a professor at England's University of Surrey, said the material was unlikely to present a major hazard. He said Sodium-22 can be made in medical accelerators and is usually not produced in reactors. It is also not used in reactors as a component of fuel, he said. The customs agency said the objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport. A criminal investigation is under way. No details were available on the identity of the Iranian passenger, who apparently flew to Tehran on the flight. Iranian news media quoted an embassy official in Moscow as saying any reports that the passenger had been arrested were false. ""These false allegations are meant to destroy relations between Iran and Russia,"" the official told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. ""A month ago there was a misunderstanding about a university student who was carrying material used in dentistry,"" he said.

Right: Sperm donors have been handed the right to play a part in the lives of their biological children following a landmark High Court decision . Sperm donors were handed the right to see and play a part in the lives of their biological children in a landmark High Court case yesterday. They may now also win the right to regular contact with the children, even though they are not bringing them up. The ruling by the Family Division decreed that a sperm donor need never have had a sexual relationship with a mother in order to have a say in the child’s upbringing. The judgement came in a complex dispute over parental rights between three gay and lesbian civil partner couples. This case involved a donor who had previously known the mother of the children. However, the ruling leaves open the prospect that unprecedented rights for involvement in the lives of children may be granted to sperm donors who have little or no connection to the mothers. The case threw fresh light on the agonising dilemmas that can be faced by the growing numbers of gay families. Until now the law – set down five years ago in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act – has refused contact for sperm donors who have no other legal or domestic relationship with their biological children. The case was brought by a gay sperm donor whose child is being brought up by a lesbian couple. The Family Division ruling applies because the 2008 Act extended the law governing the rights of sperm donors to cover same sex couples. The biological father and his civil partner were friends with two lesbian couples, both also in civil partnerships. He is the father of two children of one of the lesbian couples. His civil partner is the biological father of a child being brought up by the other lesbian couple.

Gay father Barrie Drewitt-Barlow declared: 'I want to go into my church and marry my husband.' He added: 'The only way forward for us now is to make a challenge in the courts against the Church.' The legal move means an early test for David Cameron's promise to the CofE and Roman Catholic bishops that no church would be forced to conduct same-sex weddings against the will of its leaders and its faithful.

Ministers set down a 'quadruple lock' in the new same sex marriage law - which received Royal Assent last month - which is supposed to protect those churches which oppose gay marriage. However the guarantees will have to be tested in the courts and gay rights groups have been expecting to bring an early challenge. Mr Drewitt-Barlow and his civil partner Tony have been a celebrated couple since 1999, when they became the first gay couple to be named on the birth certificate of a child.

b63cf42e21c04fe99b36f34afcd790ae2fd34abe,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled ""The Book"" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, ""We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort."" The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.","Oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat.

The majority report issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the George W. Bush administration deployed in the fear-laden days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The techniques, according to the report, were ""deeply flawed,"" poorly managed and often resulted in ""fabricated"" information. The report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated Washington a decade ago. Democrats argue the tactics conflict with American values while leading members of the Bush administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack. The CIA immediately hit back at the report, saying in a statement that the program was ""effective"" and substantially helped its understanding of al Qaeda's tactical operations and goals. But President Barack Obama said the report reinforced his view that the harsh interrogation methods ""were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests."" In its most graphic details, an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the CIA has previously admitted. It finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation ""in near nonstop fashion for days or weeks at a time."" ""In many cases, the most aggressive techniques were used immediately, in combination and nonstop,"" the report says.

When he questioned why he was stopped, officers pressed him for insurance information -- not something a driver should be pulled over for, he said. ""People are just tired of that happening,"" Knox said. ""Why should we get pulled over every time we get in the car?"" Knox wouldn't be surprised if Michael Brown, 18, smarted off to Officer Darren Wilson. ""He probably did. It happens quite often,"" Knox said. It's common for black people to give police attitude in the area, he said. Wilson, a white police officer, fatally shot the unarmed, African-American Brown on August 9 -- the event that started protests and violent street clashes in the town of about 22,000 people. Dozens of people have been arrested as Ferguson became a flash point of racial conflict. Black residents of Ferguson say there's been friction for years with the overwhelmingly white police department. White residents also complain the police are heavy-handed. The department was formally accused of using excessive force Tuesday in a federal lawsuit. The family of Jason Moore says he died of cardiac arrest September 17, 2011, when police fired Tasers at him, according to the lawsuit. The family says that Moore, who they say suffered a psychological disorder, was walking around naked and posed no threat to police. The public relations firm handling media inquiries of the Ferguson police did not immediately respond Wednesday to CNN's request for comment on the suit. To locals and longtime observers, tension has been brewing since the 1970s, when school desegregation and white flight changed Ferguson's demographics. Today, two-thirds of Ferguson's population is black, but arrest statistics don't reflect that. According to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are highly over-represented in crime","""People are just tired of that happening,"" Barber Mike Knox says.

""Happy New Year,"" Biden, who became the Democratic point man in the talks, told reporters. ""Did you think we would be here New Year's Eve?""

But the House of Representatives went home long before midnight, meaning nothing will get through Congress before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in, at least on paper. A source familiar with the deal told CNN that the Senate proposal would put off the cuts for two months and keep the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for individuals earning less than $400,000 or couples earning less than $450,000. President Barack Obama has long demanded that the threshold be set at $250,000. Tax rates on income above those levels would go back to the Clinton-era rate of 39.6%, up from the current 35%, and itemized deductions would be capped at $250,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples. That would generate an estimated $600 billion in additional revenue over 10 years. Taxes on inherited estates will go up to 40% from 35%, but the exemption will be indexed to rise with inflation -- a provision the source said was added at the insistence of moderate Democrats. Unemployment insurance would be extended for a year for for 2 million people, and the alternative minimum tax -- a perennial issue -- would be permanently adjusted for inflation. Child care, tuition and research and development tax credits would be renewed.

88b490711173825cd9cbf4127063f455057bdd12,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria is second only to South Africa as the country with the highest number of HIV/AIDS sufferers; one would have thought a better gift for the New Year from the government to its people would be to urge the national legislature to pass the anti HIV-discrimination bill that has been with them for a while. But alas, what the people received was a bill that further exposes them to violence and discrimination. While the signing of the bill has generated much reaction on both sides, most of its supporters have based their arguments on religion and African values, forgetting that what binds the nation together is not the divergence of religions but the respect for humanity that is enshrined in the 1999 constitution. What the same-sex marriage (prohibition) bill in fact does is negate the principle of fundamental human rights of association, expression and dignity. When a law does this, it runs the risk of breeding anarchy, an experience that people who are or are merely perceived to be gay know all too much about in the form of blackmail, extortion and fear of arrest. The law also acts against the principle of public health. With rates of HIV infection and AIDS running at 3.7% for the general population, and 17.2% among gay men, criminalizing organizations providing intervention for this population puts all Nigerians in jeopardy. Another thing to note is about the public perception of the law: while many perceive there's casual acceptance by many Nigerians of the bill, in fact many of those who have commented on the bill have not even read it. Aside from the fact that sections of this law are in direct violation of our fundamental human rights -- freedom of expression and assembly, freedom to have a private and family life -- and set back the provision of healthcare services, they effectively signify that it is open season to attack the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and mainstream society in general.

The human chain is organized by the grass-roots, citizen-led Catalan National Assembly, which last year on September 11 -- Catalonia's national day -- turned out an estimated 1.5 million people in Barcelona, the regional capital. Catalan politicians followed up by demanding a referendum on self-determination by the end of 2014, which the Spanish government in Madrid staunchly opposes. Spain's next threat: Losing 20% of its economy . While the political battle continues between Spain's two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, the human chain has emerged as the latest rallying point. Organizers say 370,000 Catalans have signed up to take part, and they predict tens of thousands more will also participate. The chain will traverse Catalonia from the north, near the French border, to the south, on its border with the Spanish region of Valencia. ""It will be an innocent but powerful image to push the process ahead, holding hands,"" said Alfred Bosch, who represents Catalonia's pro-independence Republican Left party in Spanish Parliament in Madrid. Dubbed the ""Catalan Way Toward Independence,"" the human chain shows the process can only ""go ahead, forward, and not back,"" Bosch said. But the Spanish government doubts that. It says that Catalonia, with 7.5 million people, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. Catalonia's fight for independence: Lessons from the Dutch . And Madrid insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away, even one like Catalonia that has its own flag and language. On the eve of the human chain, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said political leaders should find a way to keep Catalonia within Spain.

Tyler Weinman, 18, is under house arrest, accused of killing 19 pet cats in Miami, Florida. Tyler Weinman, 18, was fitted with an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring and escorted home by Miami-Dade Police. He also has been charged with improper disposal of dead animals and burglary in the monthlong cat killing spree. Judge John Thornton ordered Weinman released after a court-appointed psychologist found the teen was mentally competent and not a danger to himself or others. Weinman, who had been on suicide watch, flashed a quick smile to photographers and reporters as he entered the courtroom. He made no statements at the hearing. ""He's an innocent man. There's no evidence,"" said defense attorney Michael Walsh. ""When the case starts to unfold, you'll see,"" he added. ""The first thing that happened is an evaluation. He's not a danger. He's not a threat to himself or anyone else,"" Walsh said. Weinman was ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling twice a week. The teen was arrested at a party in Miami on Saturday night. Police allege he's responsible for the vicious series of cat killings that has put the manicured neighborhoods south of Miami on edge. Some of the carcasses were posed, police said. Thornton ordered the court file sealed. Investigators said Weinman might have been part of a ring committing the crimes. ""This is an ongoing investigation. We're looking to see if any other individuals are involved,"" said Terry Chavez, a spokesperson for the Miami-Dade State Attorney's office. But Weinman's defense attorney doesn't buy it.

The war began on January 17, 1991, with the start of the nearly six-week air campaign against Iraq that was followed by a 100-hour ground offensive that pushed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait. A Time magazine correspondent described the general, as he prepared his troops along the Kuwaiti border, as a man ""with a John Wayne swagger and a growl like a grizzly."" Schwarzkopf, dubbed ""Stormin' Norman"" by his troops because of his reported temper, captured the public's imagination with his plain, frank talk about the war's progress.

But when al-Baghdadi declared  in an audiotape released last week his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen, as well as other Middle Eastern countries, it was too much for the AQAP leadership to stomach. By claiming Yemen for his caliphate, al-Baghdadi had called into question the very right of AQAP to exist as a separate and autonomous jihadi group, leaving its leadership no choice but to push back. ""We did not want to talk about the current dispute and the sedition in Syria... however, our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate [and] they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance, and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them,"" al-Nadhari stated, according to a translation by the SITE intelligence group. ""The announcement of the caliphate for all Muslims by our brothers in the Islamic State did not meet the required conditions,"" al-Nashari argued, because other jihadi groups were not consulted.

The victims' houses were also burned down. A note, apparently written in the form of a ""haiku"" poem -- a typically short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home next door to one of the burned out homes. Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a ""suspicious"" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN. The following morning, two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims' respective homes. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. Despite feverish media speculation, Harada refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings, though he said the man, who's been missing since Sunday, could provide valuable information about what happened. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: ""Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows."" Mitake is a remote, mountainous hamlet with only 16 inhabitants. According to local media, the man police are hunting lived alone and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents. Reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7-8 years ago. One of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.","A 63-year-old man is being sought in connection with the murder of five people in a remote Japanese hamlet.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday it flew an employee back to the United States from West Africa by chartered plane after the staff member came in contact with an international healthcare worker who later tested positive for Ebola. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the employee was 'feeling fine' and had been scheduled to return to the United States from West Africa anyway. The staffer's exposure was 'low-risk', the CDC said in a statement. According to the statement, the staff member worked in 'close proximity', which it defined as within three feet, and in the same room with the ill person for a prolonged period during the period that that individual had symptoms. Home: A CDC employee who came in contact with an Ebola patient, returned to the U.S. from West Africa on Wednesday. That employee has not displayed symptoms of the disease and is not believed to pose a risk to the public. Above, a photo showing the Ebola virus . The CDC transported the staff member via chartered plane because its regulations require that people who have contact with Ebola patients who travel long distances must travel by private means for 21 days after the last contact, the statement said. The provision is designed to protect other travelers in case the exposed person develops symptoms during the flight, it said. According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and through indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. According to the CDC statement, the staff person is not sick with Ebola, does not show symptoms of the disease and 'poses no Ebola-related risk to friends, family, co-workers or the public'.

The letter also suggested that their mother, Katherine Jackson, suffered a ""mini-stroke"" recently, which her lawyer quickly disputed. Family, fans mark Michael Jackson's death three years later .

In Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel ""The Leopard,"" set in 19th century Sicily, a young nobleman tells his conservative uncle that clinging to the past will not work. ""If we want things to stay as they are,"" he says, ""things will have to change."" The Kremlin's proposed game of musical chairs is the kind of change whose only purpose is to keep things as they are. Putin and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when Medvedev's presidential term expires. The only question was in what configuration the two leaders would return. To stay in the same positions would have smacked of stagnation. Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat. It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights. Some will predict a tightening of authoritarian rule. Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much. For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so. Those who imagine that a second Medvedev term would have produced dramatic breakthroughs face the problem of explaining why his first term did not. Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the ""reset"" of recent years. Improved relations with the US could not have been pursued had Putin not approved of the policy. Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team.

He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned. The family of murdered Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death . However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island. Mr Gobat’s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: ‘We’re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action. ‘Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.’ The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty. The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently.

""Winning the title is never easy but through our good organisation and solid play we hope to show it's within our grasp."" It took around 90 seconds for Juve to move ahead through Vucinic, before Pirlo produced one of his trademark curling free-kicks to double the lead. Marchisio added a third with a low drive after picking up Sebastian Giovinco's pass. Atalanta's day grew even worse when it was reduced to 10 men following Thomas Manfredini's rash challenge on Giorgio Chiellini, which earned him a second booking. Magical Milan . Elsewhere, Milan continued its rich vein of form by defeating Pescara 4-1. Alberto Nocerino fired the Rossoneri ahead after just 36 seconds to register the second fastest goal in Serie A this season.

5bc050a4cade5868f3ab4e81f6dce94d80284bbe,"Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili conceded his party's defeat Tuesday, setting the stage for the nation's first peaceful, democratic transition through election since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. Saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year. The result of Monday's election means Georgia will have a multi-party parliament, boosting democracy in the nation, observers said. The vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about Saakashvili. He took power in 2004 after the Rose Revolution, the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections. Saakashvili is credited with having changed the country by moving toward integration with the West, with steps such as seeking membership in the European Union and NATO. He also revamped the nation's economy, retooling it to reflect a free market system. But critics said that beneath the surface, his government was dominated by Soviet-style ""administrative measures."" Ivanishvili, whose Georgian Dream alliance won a majority of seats in the 150-member parliament, said the new government would seek to mend the country's troubled relations with Russia. The two nations fought a brief but bitter war four years ago over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. ""Restoring relations with the Kremlin is one of our main tasks and we will strive in every way to do this,"" he told CNN. ""I think it's achievable but not easy. First we have to convince the Kremlin that our strategy toward NATO and Europe is not harmful to and does not contradict Russian interests."" NATO ambitions . His coalition shares the outgoing government's ambitions to join the NATO alliance, he said. Russia and Georgia would also need to work together in the future to resolve the issue of separatist territories, Ivanishvili said.

Six teams, including 39 flood fighters, were sent to the Olympic Peninsula and the Chehalis, Nooksack, Skagit, Snohomish and Puyallup river basins to monitor areas of concern and provide real-time river condition observations to the local and federal emergency operations centers, officials said. The Corps also supplied two pumps to the city of Orting at its request and 15,000 sandbags to Snohomish County. Monday morning, the National Weather Service was reporting major flooding on the Snoqualmie River at Carnation and moderate flooding on the Snohomish River at Snohomish. Flooding also was occurring or was predicted for areas along the Green, Nooksack, Skagit, Skokomish and Chehalis rivers, according to the weather service's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. The Stillaguamish River, which Sunday evening rose to a record level at Arlington, had receded below flood stage Monday morning and will continue to drop, the prediction service said. The rain that led to the flooding also triggered mudslides that shut down passenger trains north and south of Seattle over the weekend.

6c0a64179c3297b659dcf8bdf759fc6a9343a06c,"(CNN) -- They're still massively undeveloped compared to their Thai neighbors, but Cambodia's islands are starting to get the attention they deserve. Whether you're looking for an all-night party or an underwater adventure among pristine coral reefs, Cambodia's got an island for all types and all budgets. Here are seven of the best. Best island for partying: Koh Rong . Not too long ago Koh Rong's only tourist amenities were a handful of bungalows besides miles of dense jungle and gorgeous white sand beaches. There's still amazing hiking and trekking on the island in the parts of the jungle that loggers haven't destroyed, but in the last few years dozens of cheap accommodations have been built and the place has become a backpacker Shangri-La. Though Koh Rong remains surprisingly undeveloped, at least by Thai island standards, its business owners are notoriously party-friendly, bringing in generators to keep the music going until the wee hours and offering live DJs and free-beer happy hours. A 24-hour bar and a permissive attitude towards ganja have made the island a go-to spot for sun burnt travelers who want to bake on the beach by day and get toasted by night. Getting there: High-speed ferries run from Sihanoukville (Speed Ferry Cambodia, Serendipity Beach Road, Sihanoukville, +855 34 934 744), which takes 50 minutes from shore and costs $15 return. In terms of accommodation, Vagabonds (+855 15 662 437, kohrongvagabonds@gmail.com) caters to the party set while Monkey Island (+855 81 830 991) and Paradise Bungalows (+855 92 548 883) are a quieter option. Best island for relaxing: Koh Rong Sanloem . Koh Rong Sanloem has long been a favorite of expats in Phnom Penh, who head to the quiet island for weekends at Lazy Beach, once the only accommodation option here. More recently, a dozen new places have sprung up on the opposite side of the island, Saracen Bay -- a heart-shaped inlet with calm turquoise surf and beautiful beaches.

Bacton Cricket Club in Norfolk has been told that it can only use proper cricket balls for practice inside the cricket nets and not on the field as it has done for 37 years.

Bowled out: Club members, left to right, Scott Cain, Kurtis Gale, 18, Ramone Stringer and Josh Cain, 13 . But club officials have refused to agree to the new set of rules, governing the use of the Cubitt Memorial Playing Field in Bacton. Club chairman David Gale said talks were now in place to move the team away from the village to a new base at nearby North Walsham High School. He said: 'We are a cricket team - how are we supposed to practice without cricket balls? Are they expecting us to use tennis balls instead? 'It's upsetting - I've spent 10 summers nurturing the cricket square and you can really bat on it. The rules are untenable.' Mr Gale said it was common for batsmen and bowlers at any club to practise outside of the nets, adding that the nets at the ground were of a poor quality. The move will mean that club cricket will no longer be played in the village and the name of Bacton Cricket Club, established in 1934, will disappear.

Nearly 92% of Congress -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as Christian, according to a study by Pew Research's Religion & Public Life Project. That number is slightly up from 90% in the 113th Congress and continues a trend where the percentage of Christians and Jews in Congress outpaces their national average. Though Christians dominate both parties, Democrats are more religiously diverse than Republicans. Of the 301 Republicans in the 114th Congress, Jewish freshman Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is the only non-Christian. A large majority of Democrats in Congress (80%) are Christian, with 44% Protestant, 35% Catholic and 1% Mormon. But unlike Republicans, Democrats in Congress are 12% Jewish and have two Buddhist, two Muslims, one Hindu and one unaffiliated member. ""You could say that the religious diversity in Congress is concentrated on the Democratic side,"" said Alan Cooperman, director of religious research at Pew. ""The vast majority of the Jews, all of the Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus in Congress and the one unaffiliated member are all on the Democratic side."" Congress, the most representative and responsive branch of the federal government, has seen some aspects of their religious affiliation mirror nationwide trends. For example, as the country has grown more religiously diverse over the last 50 years, so has Congress. Only 3% of the 87th Congress (1961-1962), according to Pew, was non-Christian. Today, that number has roughly tripled to 6%. What's more, there has been a noticeable decline in Protestants that mirrors nationwide trends. In 1961, 75% of Congress and roughly 2/two-thirds of the country identified as Protestant. Fifty-seven percent of the 114th Congress is Protestant, while 49% of the country identifies as such today.

Moscow police launched a no-nonsense crackdown on suspected illegals working on stalls in a market. Officers prodded suspects with batons and pinned them against police vans as searches were carried out. No nonsense: Immigration officers and police yesterday raided Teply Stan market in Moscow looking for illegal immigrants . This man was spread-eagled against a police bus . Tough: Out of 11 million migrants currently living in Russia, four million are believed to be illegal immigrants . Others were forced to keep their arms in the air while police looked for documents – or a lack of them. The suspects were then frog-marched on to a police bus with their hands on the shoulders of the person in front, and driven away from the Teply Stan market to face a rapid expulsion from  the country. The approach is in stark contrast to last month’s softly-softly dawn swoop by British police on an illegal camp of 63 Romanian gipsies in central London’s exclusive Park Lane. After being detained, the gipsies were offered free flights home if they agreed to leave Britain immediately. Humiliating: Once they have been searched, the suspected illegal immigrants were lined up single file and marched onto the police bus . Not happy: Looking solemn, and under the guard of a fierce looking police officer, the men are marched away . Questioning: A police officer quizzes this man as he searches his items . Only 20 accepted. The rest were allowed back on the streets after being ordered to leave the country within 30 days. Just three days later dozens were back at the litter-strewn camp, which has  been blamed for a rise in petty crime in the West End.

Japanese cabinet minister Yoshitaka Shindo followed up with a visit of his own on Wednesday.

Porters remove goods from a boat on Lake Chad in 2007. Lake Chad was about the size of Maryland -- bigger than Israel or Kuwait -- in 1963, satellite images show. By 2001, it covered less than one-fifth of that area -- making it smaller than Delaware or Mauritius. The drying-up of the shallow lake is fueling conflict and migration, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said. Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ""If that happens it's going to be a disaster,"" Parviz Koohafkan, director of the Land and Water Division of the FAO, told CNN by phone from Rome. The Lake Chad basin is ""one of the most important agriculture heritage sites in the world -- the biodiversity, the migratory birds, not to mention more than 20 million people living out of Lake Chad -- fisherpeople, farmers."" ""It would be a human disaster, a tragedy,"" he said. ""In this case we have people who are the poorest of the poor."" ""In addition to an approximately 60 percent decline in fish production, there has been degradation of pasturelands, leading to a shortage of animal feed estimated at 45 percent in certain places in 2006, reduction in livestock and biodiversity,"" the agency said. The disappearance of the lake is being caused by climate change, population pressure and natural variations in climate, the FAO said. Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said. The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, ""Saving Lake Chad,"" in Rome, Italy, on Friday.

7e1885ac1bb267aa8ac3d3828e9607e278f75527,"(CNN) -- Massive global greenhouse gas pollution is changing the chemistry of the world's oceans so much that scientists now predict it could severely damage shellfish populations and the nations that depend on the harvests if significant action isn't taken. A new study from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts shows that ocean acidification is becoming a very serious problem. The study was published in July online in the journal Fish and Fisheries. ""What the study found was that in the next 10 to 50 years many countries are going to see impacts, particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels, and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods,"" said Jackie Savitz, senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization Oceana. Ocean acidification, or the changing chemical make-up of seawater, has occurred since the industrial revolution as ocean waters absorbed too much carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of human industrial activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. The Woods Hole study found that many marine animals like mollusks and corals that build hard shells and skeletons are most at risk from this. Those countries directly impacted are mostly poor and developing nations that are heavily dependent on shellfish as main sources for protein, like Senegal, Madagascar and Haiti. But the research also suggests damage caused by ocean acidification could ripple across economies around the world. It's already blamed for economic losses at oyster farms in the Pacific Northwest and the slowing of coral growth in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, according to Oceana. ""The truth is, if you look at all the effects of ocean acidification, nobody really gets off the hook,"" Savitz told CNN Radio. ""Impacts on coral reefs, for example, that can affect tourism, that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs.

5064fcf09e0ba8f8c487927fe45fd0d7410be998,"(CNN) -- Russia and Ukraine will face off again Saturday. But this time it's not the geopolitical arena where the action takes place -- but the glitzy stage of the Eurovision Song Contest. Both countries have made it through the semi-finals to compete in the grand final in Copenhagen, Denmark. The usual artistic rivalry has been given an added piquancy by the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March and eastern Ukraine is currently roiled by pro-Russian separatist protests. The organizers describe Eurovision -- widely loved for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as a non-political event meant to unite Europe through song. But in reality, politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances. This was demonstrated to an unusual degree on Tuesday, when Russia's entrants -- 17-year-old twins Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, told CNN that the contest is about national identity as well as music. ""Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,"" Adams said. ""The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities."" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion. It goes, ""...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time ... maybe there's a day you'll be mine."" Ukrainian singer Mariya Yaremchuk, who is performing a song titled ""Tick-Tock,"" said Tuesday that she was proud to be representing her country.

With Ally McCoist placed on gardening leave after tendering his resignation, McDowall prepared the players for Saturday’s Championship match but there was no improvement in performance as the team lost its fourth away fixture in succession. Hibernian's David Gray strikes the ball to put the home side 1-0 up against Rangers early on in the match . Players watch on as Gray's shot flies into the top left-hand corner of the net after just eight minutes . Early goals from David Gray and Jason Cummings saw Hibs sprint into a two-goal lead within 12 minutes, before Scott Robertson and Liam Craig extended the margin of victory in the second half as Rangers were comprehensively outplayed. ‘Going two down after 12 minutes is not an ideal start,’ said McDowall. ‘All the work we had done on the training ground during the week went up in the air. ‘I would like to apologise to the support. I am very disappointed with the performance. I don’t have any excuses for you — Hibs were the better team and deserved to win the game.’ The drubbing leaves Rangers 15 points adrift of league leaders Hearts, who moved further clear in their bid to claim the one automatic promotion spot thanks to a 1-0 win at Livingston. Jason Cummings was in the right place at the right time to slot home Hibs' second of the afternoon . Cummings celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 2-0 up against Rangers at Easter Road . Rangers’ best hope of making it to the Premiership would appear to be via the play-offs, where Hibs are likely opponents. ‘We’ve just got to keep trying to win games and see where it takes us,’ continued McDowall. ‘If it’s a play-off, we’re prepared to go there.’ McDowall admitted he had substituted midfielder Ian Black after just 33 minutes as the former Hearts midfielder was already on a booking and looking liable to be sent of",Hibernian defeated Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road on Saturday.

The exquisitely preserved brain was found in a fossil of the creature that lived in the Lower Cambrian, around 520 million years ago. The discovery reveals a brain that is surprisingly simple and less complex than those known from fossils of some of the animal’s prey. Scientists have identified a fossil 520 million years old as a brain belonging to the world's earliest predator, known as Lyrarapax. On the left here can be seen neural structures in the head of the animal, including the brain. On the right is the fossil, a nearly complete specimen of the ancient predator . The find for the first time identifies the fossilised brain of what are considered the top predators of their time, a group of animals known as anomalocaridids, which translates to 'abnormal shrimp.' The fossil of the world's earliest predator, named Lyrarapax, was found in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan. It is what is known as an anomalocaridid, which translates as an 'abnormal shrimp'. Just over five inches (13 centimetres) long, Lyrarapax was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids, which reached more than three feet (one metre) in length. Paleontologists excavating lower Cambrian rocks in southern Australia found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes, up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye, meaning they were probably highly efficient hunters. Long extinct, these fierce-looking arthropods were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s. They still have scientists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life. ‘Our discovery helps to clarify this debate,’ said Professor Nicholas Strausfeld, director of the University of Arizona's Center for Insect Science and senior author of the paper about the findings. ‘It turns out the top predator of the Cambrian had a","Scientists have identified a fossil as belonging to the world's first predator.

a341ac213e2a0899c7c75c2fa7b3d52ccfc54572,"(CNN) -- The Italian navy rescued 730 migrants from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily, it said Wednesday. The migrants, who departed in two boats from North Africa, are being taken to a port in Sicily's Agrigento province, the navy said in a statement. Those rescued include 124 women and 29 children, it said. The overcrowded boats were losing buoyancy and the migrants were not equipped with life jackets, the navy added. Italy is a major gateway into Europe for migrants who come by sea from North Africa in hope of reaching EU soil. Shipwrecks off the shores of its Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Lampedusa are common, thanks to the frequent use of overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. But despite the dangers, migrants keep coming. Some of the migrants are from African nations, particularly Eritrea and Somalia, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. According to the European border agency Frontex, more than 12,000 illegal migrants were detected off Sicily and 8,000 off Lampedusa in the third quarter of last year. Many of those arriving on Italy's shores have set sail from Libya, the agency said. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa last October shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. International organizations such as the U.N. refugee agency have called on European and other leaders to try to address the root causes of migration and to create legal alternatives to dangerous sea crossings.

0708b8fa08f611a1c568abbc713f88d9835b63fd,"One mother has revealed how she makes butter out of her own breast milk. Michelle Cohn, 26, of Rockville, Maryland, shared pictures of her creation on Reddit, calling it 'butter that I made without ever leaving my house! Pretty cool.' Describing the flavor afterwards, she told MailOnline: 'It was very sweet and it was very creamy - it was really good.' Scroll down for video . The final product: Maryland mother Michelle Cohn made butter using nothing but her own breast milk . Ms Cohn, who has a 16-month-old daughter, shared the simple process she used. The idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born. 'I needed to make sure that I kept my milk production up,' she says. 'So I was hand expressing into a little container and then I remembered one time I was at a fair and they had a butter-making contest, where they had milk in jars and you shook it. 'So I wondered if you could do that with breast milk. I looked it up online and sure enough, you could and I did it.' Sole ingredient: Ms Cohn started with a container filled with her own breast milk . More volume: She then moved it to a larger container, and continued to add milk . She says the first time she tried it, she used about two ounces of milk, and after she shook it for about 45 minutes, the first butter began to form. She shook it for another 15 minutes, which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean. 'The next day, I put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and I added to that the next day, but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and I started shaking. And that time, within about two minutes, I had butter,' she says. Ms Cohn says the result was 'not all that different from regular butter.' Solid goal: After vigorous shaking for 45 minutes, the butter began to form and she placed it in this pan . I can't believe it's butter: Ms Cohn spoons up some of the final product .

797210671d5aa7ba2e503434bcd17cb104d304a2,"(CNN) -- Two teenagers were killed and another wounded during a Christmas night shooting in Newark, New Jersey, authorities said Thursday. The shooting came less than 24 hours after three men were shot to death early Christmas morning outside a bar about a mile away, authorities said. The teens, identified as 13-year-old Zainee Hailey and 14-year-old Kasson Mormon, were pronounced dead at the University Hospital in Newark, police said. A 14-year-old who was not identified was in critical condition, the Essex County prosecutor said. Junior Clark, a Newark resident, told CNN affiliate WCBS he saw the gunman minutes before gunfire erupted. ""I saw the guy with the gun under his arm, under his jacket,"" Clark told WCBS, ""I heard when he shot."" Authorities said the motive for the shooting was unknown. The investigation was being handled by Newark's homicide major crimes task force, which includes officers from the Newark State Police, the Sheriff's Office and the FBI. Earlier on Christmas Day, a few minutes away in Irvington, three men were shot and killed outside Slick's Go Go Bar. The dead included the bar owner's son -- identified as Pierre Clervoyant, 34 -- and nightclub employee Woodley Daniel, 32. The identity of the third victim, who authorities said appeared to be an unintended target, was not released. Two other men were shot and wounded, and their identities and condition were not released. All five men were transported to University Hospital shortly after 1 a.m., where Clervoyant and Daniel were pronounced dead. Authorities said an altercation between the bouncer and the gunman appears to be a catalyst in the shooting, but the motive was being investigated.","NEW: A 14-year-old is in critical condition, the Essex County prosecutor says.

Buffeted by euro turmoil and the threat of further financial regulation, the City of London suffered a further blow yesterday as it slipped further down World Economic Forum's Financial Development Index. For the first time Hong Kong has muscled its way to top place in the rankings of the world's leading financial systems and capital markets, overtaking the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. slipped to second place although its overall score was unchanged from last year. The UK fell to third place due to lower scores on securitisation and initial public offering (IPO) activity, the Financial Development Report said. The report, launched in 2008, analyses financial development including the efficiency and size of banking and other financial services, the business environment, financial stability, and the extent of financial disclosure and market liberalisation in each centre. Hong Kong, which jumped from fourth place last year, has capitalised on a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector in the U.S. and Europe and on its proximity to China to lure more financial services to its shores. 'Hong Kong's ascent to the top of our index marks a major milestone, the first time in the report's history that the United Kingdom or the U.S. didn't come out on top,' said Kevin Steinberg, chief operating officer of the WEF USA.

Now reports have emerged that he is considering ditching the game altogether and setting up his own business. He completed a decorating course while he was in jail and now wants to make use of his new skills, the Daily Star reports. Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. The newspaper quotes a source as saying: 'His earnings used to top £20,000 a week at Sheffield United and now he is scrambling around looking for a club in the lower divisions. 'An outfit like Tranmere would pay about £2,000 a week - and even they don't want him. 'He is thinking he might be better off giving up on football and building a business.' Evans was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated.

A Missouri police officer was arraigned Friday after a grand jury indicted him in the shooting of a man who was wounded during an arrest last summer. Jacob Ramsey, a five-year veteran with the Kansas City Police Department, faces charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. A Jackson County judge entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Investigators say Ramsey shot 37-year-old Anthony Contreras on June 24 after police went to Contreras' home to serve an arrest warrant. KCTV reported the warrant stemmed from Contreras' failure to appear in court on earlier charges of burglary, tampering with a motor vehicle and resisting arrest. Police said Contreras was shot while trying to run away. His family and friends insisted at the time that he was unarmed. Authorities have not commented on whether Contreras was found to have a weapon. Ramsey waived his right to a jury trial through his attorney Friday and requested that a judge decide the case. A trial has been scheduled for April 2. Ramsey, 31, is on unpaid administrative leave, police Capt. Tye Grant said in a statement. Grant declined to comment further and referred questions to the Jackson County prosecutor. Kansas City's Fraternal Order of Police lodge called Friday's indictment 'baseless,' saying in a statement that Ramsey 'justifiably defended himself against a felon previously convicted of resisting arrest, narcotics and illegal possession of a firearm.'

Researchers found 13 sets of remains of mixed age and sex, and discovered the unusual practice of Christian burials alongside pagan burials. Personal items such as hairpins and belt buckles, remains of shoes, and a ring bearing a possible early Christian symbol were also found at the Oxford Street site in Leicester’s historic city centre. In addition, the team has found a jet ring with a 'curious' symbol etched on it, apparently showing the letters IX overlain.

It was Australia’s 10th World Cup goal and a perfect one at that. But it was more than just the quality of the goals. It was the sheer, unexpected drama of the encounter. The courage and determination of an Australian team, the lowest ranked side in the competition, that dared to dream and dared even to lead the beaten finalists of 2010 and most recent conquerors of Spain.

The Detroit chapter of the Satanic Temple set up its 'Snaketivity Scene' featuring a snake offering a book called Revolt Of The Angels as a gift on Sunday. The snake is wrapped around the Satanic cross on the 3-feet-by-3-feet display. Capitol rules require that displays have to be taken down each night. The 'Snaketivity' scene, which features a snake offering a book called Revolt Of The Angels as a gift, is on display on the grounds of the state house grounds in Lansing, Michigan, on Sunday . Satanic Temple spokeswoman Jex Blackmore said her group doesn't worship Satan but does promote individuality, compassion and views that differ from Christian and conservative beliefs. Blackmore told the  Lansing State Journal that the 'holiday season is a time of year that is celebrated in many different ways.' 'Having our government endorse one singular viewpoint or method of celebrating the season is problematic when we have a diverse community of people in Michigan,' she said.

Jones said he was happy to 'represent the light and not the darkness.' 'They could have put theirs up in July or April or sometime. They didn't need to put it up in the Christmas season,' Jones said. 'That's OK. We're going to ignore them. I'm not afraid of the snake people. I'm sure that Jesus Christ is not afraid.'

Last updated at 4:53 PM on 2nd February 2012 . A personal trainer collapsed in court after she was jailed for having sex with a 14-year-old boy during a two year affair. Suni Faith Anderson fainted and hit her head on a table after Judge Eric Ludlow told her she would serve up to 15 years. Anderson, 36, was revived by court staff and wept as she was led away from a court in St George, Utah. Personal trainer Suni Faith Anderson was sentenced to 15 years in jail for having sex with a client, 14, during workout sessions at his home. The sentence came despite pleas for leniency from Anderson's husband . Earlier her teen victim's mother had stood up in court and blasted Anderson for corrupting her son. 'This is a picture of my son when he was 14 years old,' the victim's mother said while holding up a photo of her son. 'Look. Suni, look! Does this look like someone a 34-year-old adult woman would want to have a relationship with?' The mother later called Anderson 'the worst kind of paedophile'. She revealed police had secretly recorded Anderson telling her son 'Well, you learned a whole lot, didn't you?' Anderson's husband Jason, who had pleaded for leniency, was in court to see his wife jailed. The victim's mother blasted her court and held up a photo of her 'corrupted' teenage son . The personal trainer began a sexual relationship with the boy, then aged 14, when he visited her home for training sessions. The affair lasted two years until the boy's parents found about the relationship and contacted police. The teen gave evidence against his former lover and told how everyone in his school knew about the affair.

32f0fc90e4f5d44f887c284a5c77961bd0f29265,"(CNN) -- Murder-suicides, by their very nature, leave a mountain of unanswered questions. When the killer pulls the trigger first on his victim and then himself, he takes with him to the grave the reasons that compelled the angry, desperate act. Not so in the case of Radcliffe Haughton. What prompted the 45-year-old former Marine to open fire at a suburban Milwaukee salon Sunday -- killing his wife and two other women, and wounding four others -- was foreshadowed in no uncertain terms by his estranged wife just three days earlier. At a restraining order hearing Thursday, the wife, Zina, begged the court for protection, saying her husband would surely kill her. With her voice shaking, she outlined how he'd threatened to throw acid in her face. How he accused her of cheating on him. How his red hot jealousy terrorized her ""every waking moment."" ""Things have gotten so bad. We need to separate,"" she said at the hearing, according to a recording obtained by CNN affiliate WISN. ""We need a divorce before you hurt me. I don't want to die."" The judge sided with her. Haughton was ordered to stay away from his wife for the next four years. He was forbidden from possessing a gun. But on Saturday, he bought a .40-caliber handgun from a private seller. Wisconsin law only requires background checks for purchases from a dealer. And he waited. The next day he took her life. Paul Ryan says he's 'shocked and saddened' by Wisconsin shooting . 'I don't want to die' At the bizarre Thursday hearing, Haughton acted as his own attorney -- cross-examining his wife, asking questions that the judge refused to allow. Haughton said his wife's infidelity was to blame for their failing marriage. ""I have been involved with Zina Haughton for most of my adult life. This is the woman that I love,"" he said. ""Things have not always been the best that they could have been but I can stand before the court, stand before God and say that I love her. I love her unconditionally.

The England star was viewed as a key doubt for the visit to Anfield this weekend after injuring a groin in Saturday's win over Newcastle. But both Arsenal and Oxlade-Chamberlain are growing increasingly confident that he'll be fit for Sunday. Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) could be fit to start against Liverpool on Sunday . Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) was replaced by Ainsley Maitland-Niles after injuring his groin against Newcastle . The midfielder will continue to be assessed between now and Sunday but Wenger is hopeful of being able to name the former Southampton man alongside Mathieu Flamini in central midfield at the weekend. The news reduces the chances of Wenger being forced into playing a makeshift midfield against the Reds due to a string of injuries. Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey are both out, leaving Wenger to consider playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role alongside Flamini with Lukas Podolski out wide. Oxlade-Chamberlain, meanwhile, has admitted that he and the rest of the Gunners squad must take some of the blame for their poor form. Arsene Wenger had been considering playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role against Brendan Rodgers' side . Wenger is hoping to take the Gunners back into the top four with victory at Anfield this weekend . Speaking to the Evening Standard, the former Southampton star said: 'From my point of view, Arsene Wenger is an unbelievable man off the pitch and as a manager. He's been brilliant for me and I can say that for a number of players at this club. 'He has helped us massively and so it is not just him to blame when things go wrong.

Ben Nelson of Nebraska on Saturday threw his support behind the Democrats' health care reform bill, giving the party the crucial backing it needed to avoid a Republican filibuster that would prevent a Senate vote. The first of a series of votes is set for Monday at 1 a.m., on a so-called manager's amendment, consisting of amendments crafted in the last week-and-a-half by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. At the request of Republicans, the entire package of amendments -- 383 pages -- was being read Saturday, for hours, on the Senate floor. The Senate could vote on the entire bill, a top priority of President Obama, before Christmas. However, a House Democratic leadership source told CNN that Obama's repeated requests for a health care bill to arrive on his desk by the end of the year won't be met. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the ongoing internal discussions within the party, said there is ""no chance of a conference between Christmas and New Year's."" Sen.

One YouTube user has taken a look at this hypothetical scenario - and the results are rather impressive. In a video they show how moving the planets closer would fill our sky with stunning views - and it reveals just how large some of the planets are compared to the moon. Scroll down for video . A YouTube user from Alabama has illustrated planets in the night sky (Saturn shown). They illustrated how the planets would look in the moon's position. The video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario. If it did happen, it's unlikely Earth would survive the close encounters . The video was created by YouTube user Yeti Dynamics. ‘This is a visualization of what it might be like if the Moon was replaced with some of the other planets at the same distance as our moon,’ they explain. Moon: 1,080 miles (1,738km) Mars: 2,111 miles (3,397km) Venus: 3,761 miles (6,052km) Neptune (equatorial): 15,701 miles (25,269km) Uranus (equatorial): 15,882 miles (25,559km) Saturn (equatorial, not including rings): 37,449 miles (60,268km) Jupiter (equatorial): 44,422 miles (71,490km) In order the video shows Mars, Venus, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn in place of the moon. Mercury is purposefully left off as it is a similar size to the moon ‘and hence is boring.’ With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth. Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km). Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km). Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth.

Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm . A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal. Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go. The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000. Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’ The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home. He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29. Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years. The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property. Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him. He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him. ‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again. ‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’ Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse ","Tony Martin, 67, killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29, in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home.

An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: How did you end up being born in Mexico? Lupita Nyong'o: My father is a politician. At the time he was also a professor of political science and he was organizing for democracy in Kenya. We were under an autocratic regime and after a series of unfortunate events, including the disappearance of his brother, he went into political exile in Mexico. I was born in his last year there.

When the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis released of a list of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, victims' groups complained it was incomplete. Harry Walsh wasn't on the list of 30 priests made public two weeks ago. But church documents obtained by Minnesota Public Radio show he had been accused in the 1990s of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul in the early 1980s. The archdiocese contributed to a financial settlement for the girl in 1996. Nonetheless, two archbishops allowed him to continue working in parishes until the fall of 2011, MPR reported. Accused: Harry Walsh, 79, is accused of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul, Minnesota, in the early 1980s . Archbishop John Nienstedt asked Pope Benedict last year to defrock Walsh after he learned of the abuse allegations from documents in church archives, as well as an old internal investigation that determined Walsh had an affair with a married parishioner at a church in Monticello. Walsh agreed to leave. Walsh now teaches sex education to troubled teenagers and vulnerable adults in Wright County. He signed a two-year, $1,508-a-month contract this year, according to public records. Claims: Walsh served at Holy Redeemer parish in Detroit from 1965 until 1967. In 1994, a woman reported that Walsh had sexually abused her there when she was a 15-year-old girl . He told the station he never sexually abused children.'I'd have been shocked if I was on the list because there's nothing credible about it,' Walsh told MPR. 'If I were hiding that, you wouldn't be in my house right now; I would have been very careful.'

Confirming the deficit-reduction part of his plan directly, Obama told a rural town hall crowd in Illinois on Wednesday: 'I don't think it's good enough for us to just do it part way. If we're going to do it, let's go ahead and fix it.' Obama's major economic speech will come right after the Sept. 5 Labor Day holiday. Republicans were underwhelmed. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said via Twitter that Obama could scrap the speech and just hand over a detailed plan to Congress. 'Seriously, just drop it in the mail.

A former bikie associate wept in court today as he stood accused of attempting to extort a smash repairman to the value of $10,000. Ex ‘Brothers 4 Life’ associate Nazir Akbari, 27, took the stand at Downing Centre District Court on Thursday, crying ‘I'm sorry mum’ while holding his head in his hands. Akbari and his co-accused Mohammed Nasiri, 23, have pleaded guilty to several charges stemming from an extortion attempt by the Brothers 4 Life which targeted a smash repair business last year. At their sentence hearing, the Downing Centre District Court heard the businessman, who does not wish to be identified, received two calls in July from gang members demanding $40,000. ‘We have 4000 foot soldiers, nothing can save you,’ he was told. They told the man that unless he coughed up the cash ‘We will hurt you and blow up your shop’.Akbari and Nasiri did not make those specific calls but police say the pair went to the shop a month later and demanded $10,000. Akbari and his family cried as he described his sense of shame over what he had done. He said the Brothers 4 Life gang ‘filled him with drugs’ after became involved with the Bankstown chapter of the gang. The court heard the western Sydney chapter has since 'disbanded' and Akbari wanted nothing more to do with them, but is forced to see members every day in jail. ‘They have us all together, so I just say “Hi” and “Goodbye”,’ he said. ‘I want to change, I want to become a better person’. Nasiri, meanwhile, said he was ‘foolish’ for getting involved in the gang, whose members face charges over several Sydney shootings. ‘I'm very remorseful, I'm very sorry...

A man whose full legal name is Beezow Doo-doo Zopittybop-bop-bop was arrested in Washington County, Iowa on drug possession charges. This isn't the first major arrest for 32-year-old Beezow. He became an unpronounceable household name when he was arrested in January 2012 in a Madison, Wisconsin park. His jazzy name was the talk of local news stations and the punchline of late night comedy shows. Jimmy Kimmel famously made fun of the way anchors struggled to say his name in the news.

Beezow was arrested July 20 after police pulled over a turquoise minivan weaving between lanes in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Deputies found .60 ounces of marijuana in a mason jar as well as drug paraphernalia on Beezow and his passenger Zacahary Marinan. He faces a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of drug paraphernalia and operation of a motor vehicle without registration according to Iowa court records obtained by the Wisconsin State-Journal. His trial is set for September 17 on the felony charge . If convicted he could face five years behind bars .

The newest charges in Iowa could put him behind bars for as much as five years .

Downloadable games that encourage children to spend parents' cash to proceed are being probed by the Office of Fair Trading . Video games that pressure children into spending hundreds of pounds when playing online face a crackdown from the Office Of Fair Trading. Many computer, console and mobile phone games offer players the opportunity to buy extra lives or abilities when online. It has led to many parents being left with huge credit card or mobile phone bills. Now an OFT investigation has found children are particularly vulnerable because they could feel they are letting other players down if they do not buy the content. Many games also blurred the distinction between spending virtual currency and real money and used statements or images to encourage children to make a purchase. The investigation found some games included ‘potentially unfair and aggressive commercial practices to which children may be particularly susceptible’. Now the OFT has proposed payments made by children while playing games online will not be deemed authorised, and should not be taken, unless the account holder - such as a parent - has given their informed consent. And they state that consumers should be told upfront about potential costs for playing the games, and any other important information such as whether their personal details will be shared with third parties. But Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has criticised the OFT proposals as ‘flaccid’. He said: ‘When games like My Little Pony and others charge £69 a pop for children to buy “gems”, there is something almost sinister happening. ‘Many of these free games take advantage of children’s confusion between virtual and real money and some parents’ technical illiteracy. ‘The OFT consultation is flaccid - the problems are apparent and games makers and app stores need to be held to account.

5be58b0532ecb8dd8d306fb5b1b3a82900cbc009,"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs' yacht was unveiled in a Dutch shipyard on Sunday, where the unusual boat designed by Jobs and famed minimalist designer Philippe Starck was christened ""Venus,"" after the Roman goddess of love, beauty, sex, fertility, prosperity and victory. According to Dutch website OneMoreThing, the finished ship was launched at shipbuilder Koninklijke De Vries in Aalsmeer, The Netherlands. Jobs' widow Laurene and three of their children, Reed, Erin and Eve, were at the ceremony. The Jobs family gave each of the members of the shipbuilding staff an elegant thank-you note, along with a token gift of their appreciation â€” an iPod Shuffle with the name of the ship inscribed on the back. The yacht appears to be as it was described in the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. In the book, Isaacson wrote about Jobs showing him models and architectural drawings of the yacht, which Isaacson described as ""sleek and minimalist."" 10 great quotes from Steve Jobs . According to the report, the enormous yacht is between 230 and 260 feet long, and appears to be as it was described in the Jobs biography â€” it's an extraordinary vessel with teak decks and large panes of ceiling-to-floor glass throughout. The boat is said to have seven 27-inch iMacs on board, and a photo showed six of them lined up on a single counter (see gallery below â€” by the way, you can see 7 iMacs on the bridge in exterior photos of the ship). Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? The late Apple CEO was aware he might not live to see the boat launched, but continued to tinker with its design. Now, at its christening more than a year after his death, his quotes about the yacht become even more poignant. In the Isaacson book, Jobs said, ""I know that it's possible I will die and leave Laurene with a half-built boat. But I have to keep going on it. If I don't, it's an admission that I'm about to die."" Update: Here are pics of the yacht, courtesy OneMoreThing, used with permission.

She flirts with strangers, talks gibberish and sometimes spins in circles for no apparent reason until she falls down. In one hand is her liquid of choice -- watered-down orange juice in a sippy cup. The 14-month-old toddler is the sort of barfly who's at the center of a recurring and heated debate: Should parents be allowed to bring their babies and children to bars? It is a question in Brooklyn, New York, that's fired up online arguments, prompted unofficial protests and made outsiders giggle. And while the issue may not be exclusive to that area, it's the stuff disputes are made of in what Sasha's dad, Matt Gross, calls the kid-heavy ""greater stroller zone"" of Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods. Single hipsters and others without (and sometimes with) kids complain about being asked to watch their language, to not smoke outdoors near strollers and to keep their drunk friends under control so as not to scare the little ones. They don't want to feel pressure to play peekaboo. They want to cry over their beers, they say, without having an infant drown them out. If anyone is spitting up, they want it to be them. ""I will get up on the subway for kids. I will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a G-rated movie.

The adults who bring their offspring to bars, she suggests, are ""clinging to their youth."" Parents, on the other hand, say that as long as they're responsible and their kids behave, they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends. And, they might add, in a place like New York -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out, too.

This includes heavy hitters such as the All Blacks, Australia and the Lions, not to mention smaller teams in the RaboDirect PRO12 and Ranfurly Shield. Unfortunately, South African teams are not licenced. But for all of this authenticity, the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists.

510d5954f297660cf45478a5945633fdcafef432,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court on Thursday postponed a decision on whether to grant bail to a Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Quran in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the capital, Islamabad. The Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl, identified as Rimsha, in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past. Tahir Naveed Choudhry, one of Rimsha's lawyers, has sought bail for her, saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail where adults are also being held. To back up his argument, Choudhry cited a report on Tuesday by an independent medical board stating that Rimsha was 14. The doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age. But on Thursday, the lawyer for the man accusing Rimsha queried the legal validity of the board's report. The lawyer, Rao Abdur Raheem, said the seven-doctor board was constituted by the local authorities, not by court order. As a result, the court adjourned until Saturday to allow time to verify the medical report. Raheem said he was representing the accuser free of charge because he believes God will reward him for his work. The police have said that Rimsha is illiterate and has not attended school. They said last week that she had told them that she had no idea that there were pages of the Quran inside the documents she alleged to have burned. The court faces a difficult decision amid concerns that if Rimsha is released on bail, she could be at risk from Muslims angered by the allegations against her. Choudhry, who is also a leading member of the Christian community and member of the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, said Rimsha is too young to stay in prison and would be safer joining her family, who are now in hiding. ""She was crying in the jail and missing her parents,"" he said.

The ongoing feud of millionaire neighbours in Point Piper, Sydney, has flared up again after a tribunal ordered car wash king Anthony Sahade to stop behaving in a 'threatening and aggressive manner' toward his neighbours. Mr Sahade, 44, who owns the Crystal Car Wash chain has been involved with ongoing disputes with his neighbours since he and his wife Rita, 40, purchased the waterfront mansion on Wolseley Rd for $11.2million in 2005.

696731f0ed7cc4a1551cbe2934a1b51feb60df98,"(CNN) -- Fourteen months to the day after an earthquake devastated Christchurch's 19th century cathedral, work is starting on a new center of worship reflecting the spirit of 21st century design. The ""cardboard"" cathedral designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban is a temporary structure which will accommodate 700 worshipers while a new permanent cathedral is built. ""The Transitional Cathedral is a symbol of hope for the future of this city as well as being sustainable and affordable,"" Richard Gray from the Transitional Cathedral Group said in a statement. The A-framed structure, which uses cardboard tubes along with timber, steel and a concrete base, is also the most stable shape for buildings in earthquake zones, according to Ban. Designed by English architect George Gilbert Scott, Christchurch Cathedral was badly damaged in the earthquake which struck the city on New Zealand's south island on February 22 2011 claiming 185 lives. The initial 6.3-maginitude shock toppled its spire with aftershocks in the following months causing further destruction, including the west wall and its ornate rose window. In March this year, Bishop Victoria Matthews announced the cathedral would be demolished because of the ""staggering"" costs of repair estimated to be up to NZ$100 million ($82 million). The new building will go up on the site of St John's Latimer Square, another church nearby which also collapsed in the earthquake. Shigeru Ban's cardboard creation builds on previous work using the material, including paper log houses which provided emergency shelter following the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan and a ""paper bridge"" which was erected on a site near the Pont du Gard in southern France. The cathedral is the largest emergency structure he has designed and will cost around NZ$5 million ($4 million) to complete. ""It's a symbol of life. New life in Christ for Christians, and it's right beside a place of death, and life is stronger than death,"" Bishops Matthews told TVNZ.

They are typically shocked not because I'm pregnant with my second child but because they've watched me suffer through hyperemesis gravidarum during both of my pregnancies. They know that pregnancy for me is never a glowing and magical journey. Rather, it is weekly trips to the emergency room, in-home IVs and nursing care, up to 13 medications with their assorted side effects and, of course, frequent vomiting -- sometimes as many as 20 times a day. Although I normally choose to greet my acquaintances' surprise with a simple smile and ""We'll see how I feel about it later,"" I decided to speak out after learning that Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their second child. The palace says Catherine is again suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, as she did during her first pregnancy. It might seem crazy to some that I would have wanted more kids after my first hyperemesis gravidarum battle, but I simply refuse to let it define my family planning. Hyperemesis gravidarum manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy. Because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations, you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before you're out of the ""danger zone"" of the first trimester, making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if you've suffered a miscarriage. Since you are so sick, what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare, as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner, and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially.

Britain could be at risk of blackouts by next winter, the boss of one of the Big Six energy companies has warned, as old power plants are closed and have not yet been replaced. Npower chief executive Paul Massara said Britain needs new energy infrastructure as the country's amount of spare generation at peak times had fallen from 15 per cent to five per cent this year. Mr Massara said the shortfall raised concerns over the possibility of blackouts as soon as next year. Mr Massara told the BBC's Panorama programme investors needed clarity over energy policy to be provided by the Government, in order for new plants to be built. He said: 'The amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we'll be about five per cent. Next winter will be even smaller. 'So will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I don't know.' The warning came as the chief corporate officer of ScottishPower today warned the Government's carbon tax, which charges companies for burning fossil fuels, could make the country 'even more vulnerable to the threat of blackouts'. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Keith Anderson said the green levy will force coal-fired plants to close too quickly. In October the National Grid warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years as Britain's reserves of electricity had halved in 12 months. The report said Britain would have ‘margins’ of only 5 per cent, the lowest since 2007, as it headed into the freezing months.

Being HIV positive is no longer the death sentence it once was, as life expectancy of those receiving treatment is approaching that of the general population. Researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be expected to live into their early 70s - a life expectancy approaching that of the general U.S. population. However, life expectancy is lower for people with a history of injecting drugs as well as those who are not white. Cell with HIV:  Nearly nine million adults worldwide living with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream. Researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on ART may be expected to live into their early 70's . The life expectancies of nearly 23,000 individuals on ART - which consists of the combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to best suppress the HIV virus and stop the progression of HIV disease - were calculated based on mortality rates in the early to mid-2000s. Participants in the study, by the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design and the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, were aged 20 years or older. Changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2007 among HIV-positive individuals were evaluated by selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, such as drug use history and immune cell counts. The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that life expectancy at age 20 increased from 36.1 to 51.4 years from 2000-2002 to 2006-2007. The results of the study indicate increasing longevity for individuals living with HIV in the U.S. and Canada.

Since 1990, rising inequality knocked almost 7 percentage points off growth in the US, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said. The global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy, and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives. Economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor, according to the OECD . Countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality, the body's latest report states. 'The gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most OECD countries, it said. As a result, income inequality has curbed economic growth 'significantly'. The overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth, pulling away from the rest of society. But the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes 'slipping behind'. The OECD said: 'This negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40% of income earners.' In part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education, making it harder for them to increase their earning potential. The report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010. It found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 7 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the US. It is estimated to have reduced growth by 10 points in Mexico and New Zealand, almost 9 points in the UK and between six and seven Italy and Sweden in the two decades pre-recession.

For years, IE6 caused headaches for developers and prompted many users to switch to alternative browsers. It was full of security holes, and it broke nearly every web standard in the book. Since it was the default browser on many Windows machines, it was also the dominant browser in the early aughts, reaching 90 percent market share in 2002 and 2003. Unfortunately, it outstayed its welcome by a good five years, keeping a solid chunk of the market share even after Internet Explorer 7 and 8 were released. Now, StatCounter's numbers, based on an analysis of 15 billion page views in May 2010, indicate that IE6 usage in the U.S. has fallen to 4.7 percent from 11.5 percent in the last 12 months, meaning that IE6 is finally becoming a footnote in the history of the Internet.

Parking the bus? Not a chance . The match was a real battle of styles. The Argentines were happy to soak up the pressure, defend aggressively and play on the counter attack. They were not parking the bus, with Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front they always knew one flash could unlock their opponents. The Germans, on the other hand, were a mixture of tiki-taka and power, looking to score from a 30-pass move or a corner. They dominated possession, but Argentina often looked not far from a goal. Target man: Miroslav Klose (left) goes up for a header with Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay (right) Argentina looked more tired than their opponents. It could have been because they had a day less to prepare, were taken to extra time and penalties in the semi-final whereas the Germans cruised through against Brazil.

The American Cancer Society and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids both called on the FDA to quickly develop new warnings. The cancer society said current warning labels, which have been around for 25 years, are now ineffective.

The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. Four to five feet of snow is on the ground, including about two feet of fresh powder, where the gunman escaped. ""There's a lot of snow on the ground, (and) it would be difficult to move through quickly,"" Taylor told CNN. ""And it's heavily forested."" The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called ""a normal traffic stop"" around 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET). But the suspect didn't heed a request to pull over, prompting a ranger to radio ahead requesting assistance. Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock. ""When he (the shooter) arrived at that spot, he got out (of his car) and fatally shot her,"" said Taylor. The suspect then ran into the spacious national park, whose border is about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The park -- the centerpiece being the 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, which is considered an active volcano -- comprises 235,625 acres in the Cascade Range. Entrances to the park were closed after the shooting. Taylor said that authorities were able to ""evacuate most of the people ... safely,"" with more than 100 people ""holed up in our primary visitor center"" with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard. ""We don't want to try to have those people get to their vehicle and caravan down the park road where it could be dangerous, being sniped at by a gunman,"" the spokeswoman said Sunday night. ""So for now, they are going to sit tight in the visitor center."" Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor.

4bc50dc0bccacd5ffc198c90a1cf211d962e4d2a,"All Americans would be better off if the top rate of income tax was returned to Eisenhower-era levels of about 90 per cent, economists have claimed. The recommendation would more than double the current top U.S. rate of income tax - 39.6 per cent - and runs counter to more than two decades of economic orthodoxy. At the moment fewer than one per cent of Americans reach the top income tax bracket of $406,750 for individuals and $457,600 for couples, yet the topic is one of the most emotive in U.S. politics. Post-war consensus: President Dwight D Eisenhower presided over a successful U.S. economy in which high taxation was seen as normal practise for those earning incomes far above the national average . Low rates: This graph shows how the U.S. income tax rate has fluctuated in the past century . Fabian Kindermann from the University of Bonn and Dirk Krueger from the University of Pennsylvania make the case for radically higher rates of taxation in a new paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their conclusions come nearly 25 years after the idea that the wealthy should be allowed to keep as much of their money as possible became the accepted political norm. Beginning with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, spurred by the new ideology of neoliberalism, the U.S. saw radical cuts to the top rate of income tax until it fell to less than 30 per cent. The architects of these policies were spurred by ideologues like the radical capitalist Ayn Rand, an originator of the 'wealth creator' myth, who believed rational self-interest would create the most-perfect economic conditions. Taking money out of the hands of the rich was not only unjust, she and her acolytes believed, but also economically illiterate, since those who were best at making money would know the best way to spend it. But as Dr Kindermann and Dr Krueger point out, these tax cuts coincided with a spike in inequality, with the total share of U.S. household income accruing to the top 1 per cent do","Fewer than one per cent of Americans reach the top income tax bracket of $406,750 for individuals and $457,600 for couples.

But it denied categorically that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep ‘simultaneously’ on the packed long-haul flight.

Corey Ash, a passing UPS driver, noticed a silver Saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall, with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel. Ash stopped to investigate. He switched off the car's engine, pulled Mertz out, and laid him on the ground. Ash called 911 and started pumping the older man's chest. The next few minutes would be absolutely critical for Mertz.

ffcc51db54f8ebdf9a00407213c1d8ab859185b3,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Race and politics are a combustible combo that explodes into headlines when an ex-president lights the fuse, as Jimmy Carter did recently. President Obama during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics. ""When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,"" the Democrat told students at Emory University on Wednesday. ""I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African-American,"" he added. The controversy erupted this week when Carter first raised the race issue to NBC. ""An overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man,"" he said. Bill Cosby, a black comedian and actor, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter. ""During President Obama's speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,"" he said. CNN contributor David Gergen said that some of the allegations of race-baiting might have some weight among Democratic voters. ""Jimmy Carter, I'm afraid, is not alone in his views,"" he said. But Gergen warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to Obama's ideology. ""But I think it's wrongheaded, and I think it's unfair, and I think it's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents, most of the opponents of health care reform, to say that they're racist,"" he said. ""Seven previous presidents have tried to bring health care reforms of this kind. All seven have failed. And, as I recall, all seven were white.""

More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading, writing and physical skills.

More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading, writing and physical skills (picture posed by models) Girls are racing ahead in every area of early development measured by the Government, with 69 per cent judged to be ready to start formal schooling. The figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘must do more’ to help toddlers learn. Despite improvements in most parts of the country since last year, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah insisted that ‘too few young children are ready for school’. The figures show that just 59 per cent of boys can write a simple sentence or a letter to Father Christmas at the age of five against three-quarters of girls. Just 68 per cent of boys can read simple sentences compared with 80 per cent of their female classmates. Commenting on the figures, Mr Gyimah said: ‘We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. ‘The statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are put on the right path. ‘Parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care, they’re not only safe, happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends","More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education.

This boosts the production of collagen, which gives skin its structure. IS IT SAFE? If you have sensitive skin, you may see reddening at first.

In a move intended to reduce checkpoint congestion while improving security, flight attendants will be allowed to display credentials instead of undergoing physical screening. They will still be subject to random, unpredictable searches, however. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the change is in keeping with his philosophy of ""risk-based"" security, because it speeds up screening of known ""low-risk"" travelers, while allowing TSA screeners to focus on unknown travelers. Authorities investigate needles in sandwiches . Flight attendant representatives have long argued that flight attendants deserve the same treatment as pilots because they undergo identical background checks and are entrusted with access to the cockpit. The Known Crewmember program is ""good news"" for U.S. aviation, flight attendants and the traveling public, said Veda Shook, head of the Association of Flight Attendants. ""We are the last line of defense in security aboard the aircraft,"" Shook said. In addition, the program will eliminate flight attendants' ""uncomfortable"" practice of jumping to the head of the security line so they can make their flights on time, she said. High-flying family shares travel secrets . In May, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security instructed the TSA to include flight attendants in the Known Crewmember program. Flight attendants -- there are 90,000 of them in the United States -- will be eligible if they work for U.S. airlines that participate in the program and are flying from U.S. airports.

The question is whether that would help the situation. No one argues that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 gives Obama the authority to take over all efforts to plug the well gushing 5,000 feet beneath the surface. However, officials of oil giant BP, while acknowledging their failure so far to stop the leak, say no one -- not even the U.S. government -- can match their company's know-how and technology in such a crisis. ""I don't think anyone else could do better than we are,"" Doug Suttles, the BP chief operating officer, said Monday. ""I know that that's frustrating to hear and our performance, to this point, I wish was better. I wish this was done. But we're doing everything we can. And I don't actually believe anyone could do any better, unfortunately."" Administration officials also have said they lack the technology -- such as unmanned submarines that can work at such ocean depths -- that has been deployed by BP. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who previously threatened a government takeover of the mission, made clear Monday that BP must be involved in trying to stop the leaking oil. ""There are areas where BP and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight, such as a deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to kill the well,"" Salazar said Monday. ""BP and the private sector, with the help of federal scientists, are the ones who must get that problem solved and we have the oversight capacity in the administration to make sure that they are doing that.""

An extremely rare set of 400-year-old playing cards made of silver and gold that were owned by a princess have been discovered. The extraordinary deck of ‘silver cards’ gilded with gold were first sold at auction at Christie’s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010. Recently a historian described them as one of only five known decks of silver cards and the only complete set. Gilded with gold: The set of 'silver cards' is one of only five known decks and the only complete set and was created around 1616 . Legend has it that the cards were owned by Portuguese princess Infanta Carlota Joaquina, who married a prince in Portugal before fleeing to Brazil when Napoleon’s armies marched into Iberia in 1807. Stories say she took the set with her. Timothy Schroder, a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts, recently wrote in his book: ‘Only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the Zilkha set (referring to the current owner) — is complete. ‘They were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector's cabinet, or Kunstkammer.’ Creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury, a deadly chemical, a process which is illegal today. Even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous. Risky process: Mercury was used to gild the gold to the silver - a process which is illegal today and even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous . Mr Schroder was quoted in Live Science saying: ‘I don't think they quite understood why it was dangerous, but they did appreciate the dangers of it. ‘You ground up gold into kind of a dust, and you mix it with mercury, and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear.’ He explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process ‘that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silve","The extraordinary deck of 'silver cards' gilded with gold were first sold at auction at Christie’s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010.

ae2d9124a6d432e82c547b585727ea42acd6b468,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Rapper Kanye West and his business manager must complete 50 hours of community service in exchange for the dismissal of charges stemming from a Los Angeles airport scuffle with paparazzi last year. Kanye West must complete 50 hours of community service by December 23. West has already attended 12 hours of anger management classes and paid for the camera that was broken during the incident, his lawyer told the judge during a hearing Friday morning. Police arrested West and Don Crawley on September 11, 2008, after an altercation with a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos, airport police said. West and Crawley were later charged with three misdemeanors counts: vandalism, battery and grand theft. ""There was not a situation where there was a lot of time for either defendant to reflect on what they were doing,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Mark Zuckman. Zuckman, who presided over Friday's hearing, said he could take the position that ""a brief impulsive response"" by West and Crawley ""doesn't necessarily demonstrate a severe character flaw that needs to be addressed in a criminal case."" Still, he said, he did not want ""to send a message that ripping the camera from someone's hand and destroying it [in] an act of vandalism is acceptable, no matter what kind of provocation caused them to be angry. There are other remedies."" Zuckman said if anyone had been injured in the incident, his decision would have been different. West and Crawley have until December 23 to complete 50 hours of community service, Zuckman said. If they do, he will dismissed the charges. If convicted, West could have faced up to two years and six months in jail, while Crawley could have faced up to five years, according to Frank Mateljan, the spokesman for the city attorney.","Kanye West, Don Crawley charged with vandalism, battery, grand theft.

The champion driver, from Germany, was transferred last week to Switzerland for rehabilitation from a hospital in Grenoble, France, where he was kept in a medically induced coma for more than three months. The Grenoble hospital's media office said in a statement that Kehm ""told us that a person intended to sell to the press a document allegedly issued from the medical records of Michael Schumacher."" ""Without knowing the precise nature of the document, the Grenoble Hospital decided to sue for 'theft and breach of medical confidentiality' so that an investigation can be initiated."" A spokesman for the German newspaper Bild, Tobias Frolich, told CNN that the tabloid was among a number of media outlets to be offered Schumacher's alleged medical records, but that ""the editorial office decided to reject the offer.""

Here's the twist -- this all comes with a generous helping of dirt. Not normal, backyard variety dirt, special nutrient-rich soil. The unique tasting menu is the creation of Toshio Tanabe, a former gymnast and boxer turned culinary inventor. Tanabe says the dirt menu was a logical addition for his quaint restaurant, Ne Quittez Pas, which is located in Tokyo's Gotanda neighborhood. ""This is a seafood restaurant, so we have the flavors from the ocean,"" he says. ""I was also looking for flavors from the earth."" The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . But this is not the typical dirt you'd find it your backyard. It comes from a garden wholesaler, which provides the high quality soil, taken deep beneath the earth's surface -- 10 meters down, in fact. Germaphobes can take some comfort, perhaps. Tanabe tells us the soil is first lab tested, and then heated to extreme temperatures, to kill off any bacteria. After that process is complete Tanabe will work it into his menu. This special fare is certainly not dirt cheap. The set course is about US$110 per person. And how does it taste? According to one adventurous eater, who wished to remain anonymous the night of our visit, ""I didn't think it would be real dirt. I was a bit nervous. But it was a subtle taste.""

Regardless of what might be said by politicians, Iraqi or not, Western intervention to aid Baghdad in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) does not constitute a solution to the current crisis, nor does it work towards one. Far from it: direct military intervention by a Western state -- even if Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is requesting it -- would dramatically worsen the situation, and ISIS, contrary to what pro-interventionists might say, would inevitably come out on top. While all options might, as John Kerry said this week, remain on the table at this point, some are more ""on it"" than others. Indeed, it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western ""boots on the ground"" (besides a very limited presence to secure national assets). If there were to be any intervention,  therefore, it seems likely it would take the form of ""targeted strikes"" from the air -- be they via drones, jets or missiles. And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on ""ISIS strongholds"" in order to ""minimize civilian casualties."" Removed from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS. Indeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent ""Crusader threat"" and defend the group's false legitimacy. In short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become. This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the ","The West should not militarily intervene in Iraq, writes Peter Bergen.

Conservationists . from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have developed a way of using . the space technology to count how many of the mammals are currently . living in our seas.

The creatures could be distinguished from other light-coloured spots by comparing the satellite pictures with different images of the same island. An earlier survey suggested there were around 100 bears, and the satellite estimate confirmed this. Wildlife experts now believe that using satellite pictures could be useful in keeping track of the Arctic polar bear populations, as the speed at which Arctic ice is melting has increased.

The main rivals to the Red Bull driver are his teammate Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who are tied for second in the standings. McLaren pair Lewis Hamilton and reigning champion Jenson Button are also still in contention for the crown. Webber knows he will become champion if he wins one of the season's remaining races and scores podium finishes in the other two, with trips to Brazil and Abu Dhabi finishing off this year's calendar. The Australian driver told the official F1 website: ""It's ridiculous to start calculating things because a lot of things can happen.

I'm doing my best and then hopefully the result will take care of itself."" Alonso has made a big impression in his first season with Ferrari and will take away the positives even if he cannot land the title for the third time. ""In terms of happiness, in terms of motivation, driving, the team itself, it's the best one. Obviously it will be nice to become champion this year but even if we cannot do it, I will anyway have great, great memories of 2010."" Button and 2008 champion Hamilton know they have to make up ground fast at the Korea International Circuit this weekend. Button, who is fifth in the rankings, is aware of how difficult it will be for him to close the 31-point gap between himself and Webber, but he is excited to still be involved in the fight for the sport's top prize.

Rock writes: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.' Rogen, the star and director of the almost-banned comedy The Interview issued a statement about this weekend's blockbuster hit American Sniper, comparing the Clint Eastwood-directed film to Nazi propaganda. 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' Rogen tweeted on Sunday. Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride. 'American Sniper ","The Clint Eastwood film profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in military history. While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the military.

8c6a3a845f42177e889155e3136df55c8f1f01ab,"(CNN) -- Standing atop a craggy, coastal outcrop on the outskirts of Reykjavik, Helgi Sveinsson checks his footing before adopting a statuesque pose reminiscent of a Nordic warrior. With chest puffed out and a javelin at his side, the 35-year-old's stance has a classical feel, but with a distinctly modern twist. In the dying light of a frigid November day in the Icelandic capital, the jagged silhouette of a carbon fiber running blade can be made out before its tip trails into the inky murk beneath. The prosthetic limb has helped Sveinsson become one of the most successful para-athletes of recent times propelling him to the top of the podium in the javelin over the last two seasons. At the 2013 world championships in Lyon, France, he took gold and repeated the feat earlier this year at the European Championships with a winning throw of 50.74 meters competing in the F42 class -- a category for athletes who have suffered amputations above the knee. ""I just love everything about the javelin,"" Sveinsson told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's just the feeling when you hit the sweet spot -- when you're throwing a perfect throw, there's nothing that compares to that ... it's the perfect feeling."" Like most Paralympic competitors, Sveinsson has had plenty thrown at him during his life. A talented handball player in his youth, Sveinsson looked to be heading for the professional ranks when, on the cusp of adulthood, his life took an abrupt and tragic turn. ""I was 18 years old when I started feeling little bits of pain in my leg. And then the pain got worse, and worse, and worse,"" he explains. A period of agonizing limbo involving hospital visits, tests and scans came to a horrifying conclusion with a diagnosis of bone cancer. He embarked upon a course of chemotherapy but after five months of treatment the tumor showed no signs of shrinking and the decision was made to amputate his left leg above the knee in 1999.

bf96ac83fa186e7d5f956be7cefc94650fe9cc9f,"(CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal ""cash for clunkers"" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. ""I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" said Andrew Sable, who got $9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. ""I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the ""cash for clunkers"" program » . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg.

An Indiana man forced his wife to sign a sex slave contract so he could sexually abuse and torture her — while he coerced her by controlling her diabetes medication, police charge. Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes, forcing her to wear a choke collar and raping her repeatedly. He is charged with 38 felonies ranging from strangulation, criminal confinement and domestic battery, WHAS11 reported. Some of the charges stem from incidents that happened while his two kids were nearby, according to WBIW. Authorities say Harden wrote out an elaborate contract defining himself as the 'master' and his wife as the 'slave.' His wife said she couldn't leave not only because she 'loved him' — but also because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes, according to WHAS11. Seymour police arrested him on Saturday while responding to a domestic call at the couple's home. When officers arrived, they found Harden on the sidewalk while his distraught wife sobbed inside the apartment, WBIW reported. While investigating the call, police found an 11-page manual outlining 'the slave's role' and 'punishments,'  which was signed by both Harden and his wife in June, according to the station. The victim, who is not named because she was a victim of sexual abuse, said Harden forced her to sign the contract or he would leave her. She told cops that he was 'sweet' and 'swept her off her feet' when they first met via Craigslist in July 2013, according to WBIW. But soon he told her was a sadist and wanted to be her master, the station reported. The woman said he at times tied her to her bed for so long, she would urinate on herself, according to WBIW. She would often lose her consciousness during the torture sessions, court records show.","Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes, forcing her to wear a choke collar and raping her repeatedly.

""What is very troubling about this case is that the Russians are making very wild accusations against the (adoptive) parents before they have information,"" a senior State Department official told CNN. ""I think it is irresponsible of the Russians to say the parents did x, y or z before we find out what happened.

Russian officials Tuesday met with the boy's unnamed adoptive parents and his surviving brother, also adopted from Russia, after the State Department coordinated the session through Texas Child Protective Services. U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, a Russian governor halted the foreign adoption of orphans in his region after the boy's death.

The research found six per cent have asked a friend or relative to take their points and a shocking five per cent confess to paying someone. But only half of those who have swapped points say they were caught (54 per cent) and as a result 39 per cent of motorists are calling for point swapping drivers to face criminal prosecutions. Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce each received eight month prison sentences two years ago for perverting the course of justice after they lied about swapping speeding points. Data retrieved through a Freedom of Information request also showed a staggering 70,158 motorists are on the brink of being banned, holding nine points - just three from a potential ban. The Confused.com FOI request revealed the lengths people go to avoid penalty points when caught speeding . Meanwhile, more than 6,800 motorists in the UK have 12 points or more on their licence. Extraordinarily, one UK driver, who is still on the road, has a staggering 45 points, clocked up for nine speeding offences and 36 of failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver. The data was gathered by the car insurance comparison site Confused.com and showed the lengths people are willing to go to avoid a driving ban. Of the motorists who admit swapping points, more than half have done so at least three times and more than one in seven think the penalty point system is not fit for purpose. The most common reason for swapping points with someone else is to keep their license clean, while a quarter of motorists admitted asking someone to take them because they were facing a driving ban.

While the statement did not differ greatly from previous, sometimes contradictory reports from the Iranian government about the fate of the woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, it did indicate continued attention to the murder aspect of her case. ""The sentencing of Ms. Ashtiani for adultery has been stopped and (her case) is being reviewed again, and her sentencing for complicity in murder is in process,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning, but her son and human rights activists urged help for her this summer, prompting an international outcry. There have been conflicting reports about the murder charge, which relates to the death of Ashtiani's husband. Ashtiani's previous lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, said last month his client had been sentenced to death for the crime but that the sentence was commuted because the victim's family forgave her. Ashtiani, however, told the British newspaper The Guardian last month that she was acquitted of the murder in 2006. Ashtiani, who spoke to the newspaper through an intermediary, said the man who actually killed her husband was identified and imprisoned for the crime. Mehmanparast said those concerned about Ashtiani's condition should have some consideration for the family of the victim, according to Press TV. ""Defending a person on trial for murder should not be turned into a human rights matter,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani gave an interview to state-run TV last month in which she said she knew about a plot to kill her husband but that she had not taken it seriously at the time.

This woman appears to be playing a round of 'Goon of Fortune' by pegging the bag of wine on a Hills Hoist clothesline - which was also invented by an Aussie . The invention of cask wine began when winemaker Thomas Angove of Renmark, northeast of Adelaide, designed a plastic bladder as an alternative for the traditional wine bottle. The bag is placed in a box and wine is poured through an air-tight valve. Son John Angove, who's now the managing director of Angove Family Winemakers, watched his father's invention come to life when it was patented on April 20, 1965. He told the ABC the idea evolved from his father talking about creating the sack in old goat skins to a plastic bag. 'He put the plastic bag inside a cardboard box and it just grew from that,' he said. 'It was a pretty amazing idea and I remember as a youngster thinking: 'god Dad that's crazy, that'll never work, who's going to buy wine in a plastic bag?"".'

d062d19e150f69db6e5957ef12d670f5527caf5d,"(CNN) -- While China is seriously cracking down on the exchange of virtual currencies for real cash, virtual economies backed by newfound legitimacy elsewhere are quickly gaining ground in the real world. There's gold in them there screens: Real-money transactions in virtual worlds are finding new legitimacy. On June 24, 2009, the role-playing game 140 Mafia launched on Twitter, following in the footsteps of highly lucrative games Mob Wars and Mafia Wars on Facebook (and now iPhone) to link virtual-currency exchanges to real-money transactions. In March 2009, MindArk -- creator of the MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) Entropia, where one player famously bought an island for US$26,500 in 2004 -- saw its wholly owned subsidiary Mind Bank granted a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The new license allows Mind Bank to be the first bank to directly incorporate real-money transactions with virtual-world activities. Selling virtual assets directly between players for real-world cash has been strictly prohibited by most game publishers, which find themselves looped out of the profits. What has been profitable in the meantime to some hardcore players of World of Warcraft and EverQuest (and other games) is ""gold farming"" -- accumulation of ""gold,"" weapons and other status symbols of a seasoned player -- followed by the online auction of such assets or user accounts. Since games publishers began policing eBay for this type of unauthorized activity, several Web sites such as PlayerAuctions have adopted a PayPal-like approach in order to broker the trading legally, acting as an open marketplace for player-to-player exchange of digital assets.

""I am really keen to work on something really new, which eventually is going to be important for the future of Nintendo,"" he said, through a translator, in an interview here at Nintendo's offices on Thursday. ""I would like to try to do something which might be able to expand the boundary or the definition of video games."" Miyamoto spoke with CNN the day after Wired reported that the game visionary would step down as a top Nintendo director and producer overseeing the development of games and products. CNN has a syndication agreement with Wired. A Nintendo spokeswoman disputed the Wired report, which quotes Miyamoto telling colleagues that he is ready to retire. Miyamoto was being sarcastic, but that nuance was lost in translation, she said. ""Miyamoto's role at Nintendo is not changing,"" the company said in a statement. ""He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts."" The 59-year-old video-game pioneer may spend less time working directly on blockbuster games in Nintendo's biggest franchises, he said.

Two Europeans accused of murdering a young boy in the most popular tourist resort in Madagascar have been burnt to death by a mob of vigilantes, it emerged today. A third European man who was quizzed over the alleged killing of the eight-year-old boy was lynched hours later and his body set ablaze in a separate attack. The horrific killings took place on Nosy Be, an idyllic Indian Ocean island located off the northwest coast of Madagascar, which attracts holidaymakers from all over the world including Britain. Fire: Locals on the Madagascan island of Nosy Be are allegedly pictured watching one of two European men accused of murdering an eight-year-old boy being burnt to death on Wednesday night . Locals went on the rampage on . Wednesday following reports that a Frenchman called Sebastian and an . Italian called Roberto had kidnapped an eight-year-old child. There . were claims that the men, whose surnames have not been revealed, had . not only killed the boy, but cut off his tongue and genitals. Police commander Guy Bobin Randriamaro said: ‘The rioters launched a manhunt and killed the Europeans. ‘Both men were not only suspected of murdering the boys, but were also said to be trafficking human organs.’ The rampaging mob originally stormed a police station in Hell-Ville, capital of Nosy Be, where it thought the pair of murder suspects were being held. Police fired shots in the air, but it was not enough to disperse the increasingly angry crowd. Mr Randriamaro said the men were finally chased and cornered on the palm-fringed Ambatoloaka beach on Nosy Be, where they were attacked. They were kept alive long enough to be tortured, and are said to have ‘confessed’ to killing the boy, and to trafficking organs, before both were set on fire. Both died from their burns.

5f13ddb11f623d9de0af761aa14afa538a4f11fa,"(CNN) -- Mexico's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels, but it hasn't hurt its tourism industry, officials say. International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. ""The data doesn't lie,"" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. ""Tourists keep choosing Mexico."" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing ","International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011.

25486c87b42618fd63074d4df4699d515c8bf476,"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- France's President Nicolas Sarkozy made a landmark visit to Haiti Wednesday, announcing more than $100 million of additional aid to the former French colony where 212,000 people were killed by an earthquake five weeks ago. Sarkozy is the first French president ever to visit the country which has in the past demanded huge reparations from France to compensate for slavery-era exploitation before Haitian independence two centuries ago . He told a news conference that an extra €100 million ($136 million) was being made available to help reconstruction efforts, bringing France's contribution to the the aid effort to €320 million. Sarkozy was scheduled to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and take a helicopter tour of earthquake-devastated zones, Sarkozy's office said. He also planned to tour a French Civil Security hospital and meet with French teams and injured Haitians, his office said. He planned to meet members of the government involved in reconstruction and members of the United Nations mission in Haiti. Sarkozy's trip was scheduled to last less than five hours, after which he planned to go to the French island of Martinique for an overnight stay. Thursday, Sarkozy planned to visit French Guiana on South America's northeastern coast before returning home, his office said. Sarkozy is the first European head of state to visit Haiti since the January 12 earthquake, Agence France-Presse reported. France has had close cultural ties with its former colony since independence, but diplomatic relations have sometimes been fraught, with Paris occasionally expressing concerns over instability in the Caribbean nation. In 2004, France called for the resignation of then president Jean Bertrand Arstide, who was subsequently ousted in a 2004 rebellion, after his government  demanded that France pay $21 billion in reparations.","Nicolas Sarkozy is the first French president ever to visit Haiti.

In 2014, it is computer games, books, online comics, miniature figurines and more, aimed at staying relevant in a digital age. Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of the game, is launching the latest version along with a massive campaign called Tyranny of Dragons. But on such a plethora of platforms, how is it possible to create an overarching idea that transcends platforms? The publishers say it's a simple concept known as sharing. The high adventure, in which followers of dragon queen Tiamat aim to take over the world, coincides with the release of the fifth edition of rules for tabletop version of D&D. But the company wanted to expand how players could join in the new storyline and create a community of shared experiences. ""The big part of a role-playing game is, you can do whatever you want. But we want you to end up at the same place at the end of the adventure,"" said Mike Mearls, senior manager for Dungeons & Dragons research and development. ""There are many ways to get there, but having a big event that brings everybody back together is part of the fun, because once you've gone up against Tiamat, you've got something you can talk to any fellow player about, even if you've never met that person before."" The idea of creating that shared story experience over different media meant Mearls had to think about the narrative differently. It was more about creating a story bible with direction on how various creatures behave in certain circumstances rather than plotting out each monster's actions specifically. 40 years later, 'Dungeons & Dragons' still inspiring gamers .

af83548132ea85678e4c3bf24922fe3a53a95386,"In order to understand the turbulent world of Thai politics, you have to start with one name: Thaksin Shinawatra. The former prime minister has dominated the country's political scene for more than a decade despite going into exile after his ouster in a 2006 coup. Back in 2010, deadly clashes took place between security forces and Thaksin supporters who had occupied central Bangkok. They were demanding his return. Now, his sister is in power and she recently tried to pass an amnesty law that could have allowed his return. The attempt failed, but it provided fuel for the current protests shaking the capital. Here's a quick primer to make sense of it all. 1. Who is Thaksin? He's a deeply polarizing figure -- a billionaire telecommunications mogul who built his political power on policies popular with Thailand's rural villagers. His success ruffled a lot of feathers among the country's established elites, and critics accused him of corruption and autocratic rule. He was prime minister between 2001 and 2006, when the military deposed him in a bloodless coup. 2. What happened in 2010? Thaksin's ouster spurred the protest movement that developed over the years into the widespread ""red shirt"" demonstrations that occupied upscale parts of Bangkok in 2010. By that stage, the movement had broadened to represent other issues, including resentment at the military's involvement in politics and economic inequality. The crackdown by security forces on the red shirts resulted in clashes that left around 90 people dead. It has been described as the worst civil violence in Thailand's history, and the country remains severely scarred by the experience. 3. Could the current protests lead to a repeat? The situation is different this time. Those protesting are opponents of Thaksin rather than his supporters. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now prime minister.

04565cbd287f0a88669700a8191ab63f37939495,"(CNN) -- These are extraordinary times, and like a lot of Republicans I believe that a well-crafted stimulus plan is needed to put people back to work. But the Obama spending bill would stimulate the government, not the economy. Mitt Romney says Obama's spending bill would stimulate the government rather than the economy. We're on an economic tightrope. The package that passed the House is a huge increase in the amount of government borrowing. And we've borrowed so much already that if we add too much more debt, or spend foolishly, we could invite an even bigger crisis. We could precipitate a worldwide crisis of confidence in America, leading to a run on the dollar or hyperinflation that wipes out family savings and devastates the middle class. It's still early in the administration of President Obama. Like everyone who loves this country, I want him to adopt the correct course and then to succeed. He still has a chance to step in and insist on spending discipline among the members of his own party. It's his job to set priorities. I hope for America's sake that he knows that a chief executive can't vote ""present."" He has to say yes to some things and no to a lot of others. As someone who spent a career in the private sector, I'd like to see a stimulus package that respects the productivity and genius of the American people. And experience shows us what it should look like. First, there are two ways you can put money into the economy, by spending more or by taxing less. But if it's stimulus you want, taxing less works best. That's why permanent tax cuts should be the centerpiece of the economic stimulus.  Watch Romney make argument for tax cuts » . Second, any new spending must be strictly limited to projects that are essential. How do we define essential? Well, a good rule is that the projects we fund in a stimulus should be legitimate government priorities that would have been carried out in the future anyway, and are simply being moved up to create those jobs now.","Mitt Romney: We're on an economic tightrope.

b2e7c3fd6b85ce48660d6b09ba9409ada6da7f61,"(CNN) -- The week-old redesign of quick-messaging service Twitter was meant to simplify its tools and make it more accessible to newbies. But it has had some unintended consequences. Independent developers of applications that tie into Twitter's network say they have experienced significant accelerations in downloads and revenue since Twitter 4.0 launched last week. When addicts of the social network got their hands on the new version, many recoiled upon seeing the changes. They were especially vocal about the loss of some features in Twitter's mobile apps and about the private-message tab being hidden within another menu. So thousands flocked to the various app stores to get third-party apps that look more like the previous version of Twitter. Some of the most popular apps cost a few dollars, unlike the free app made by Twitter. Tweetbot, an anime-themed app for the iPhone, more than doubled its usual revenue just after Twitter's major redesign, said Paul Haddad, a co-founder for app maker Tapbot. When the small developer cut the price of Tweetbot in half on Friday, to 99 cents, revenue increased more than tenfold, Haddad said. Independent trackers of app downloads verify that Tweetbot and others experienced big gains. ""Word of mouth really goes a long way on Twitter,"" Haddad wrote in an e-mail. The maker of another popular app, Twitterrific, saw a ""bump"" after the Twitter changes, which carried through to this week, said Craig Hockenberry, the head of app maker Iconfactory. This effect is common, but short-lived, after a major change to Twitter, he said. Twitterrific, which offers a free version with ads or a full version for $4.99, experienced a similar boost in March after Twitter updated its iPhone app with a much-maligned feature called the Quick Bar, Hockenberry said. The Quick Bar, which critics dubbed Dick Bar after Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, added an ever-present ticker showing trending topics and ads. Within a month, Twitter had removed the feature.

20a9de0f2a2151da76e182fa13d47fc0168b2a1b,"(CNN) -- Croatia held off a furious late onslaught from Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria to win 1-0 in their opening Group B match in Vienna on Sunday. Emmanuel Pogagtetz, left, fouls Croatia striker Ivica Olic to concede the match-winning penalty. The Croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder Luka Modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Emmanuel Pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker Ivica Olic in the area. Slaven Bilic's team dominated the first half, and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but Olic's strike partner Mladen Petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to Vedran Corluka's cross. Austria's main threat had come from set-pieces, but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners. However, the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes. Martin Harnik fired over the bar on 78 as Croatia scrambled to clear the danger, then substitute Ivica Vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa, who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder. Pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from Umit Korkmaz, who also came off the bench, while another substitute in Roman Kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on. Croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets, having qualified top of their group ahead of Russia with a victory away to England which eliminated the British team. However, their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer Eduardo da Silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg. None of Croatia's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches, and the Arsenal forward's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on Sunday.

You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. ""The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,"" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called ""white hat"" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001.

Newspaper speculation on Monday claimed the Italian was on the verge of walking out of Stamford Bridge after a turbulent few weeks at the London club. Chelsea have lost three of their last four matches and the club sacked Ancelotti's assistant Ray Wilkins earlier this month, sparking speculation over his position. It had been claimed the 51-year-old contacted the League Managers' Association on Sunday night to discuss his position. But at a press conference ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Slovakian side MSK Zilina on Tuesday, Ancelotti said the rumors were ""totally untrue"". ""I don't know if it is enough to clarify my position today to close this rumor and speculation,"" began the 51-year-old. ""These rumors are totally untrue, I don't know why this rumor came out today in the papers. ""The LMA (League Managers' Association) called me last night to understand what was happening, but I was at home. These rumors are totally untrue. ""I have my contract until 2012 here in this club, I said a lot of times I would like to stay here, that I love this club, I love these players and have a lot of confidence in these players and this squad so there is no reason to change my idea.

My aim is to stay here, I don't want to say like Ferguson because I think it is impossible, but my aim is this. I would like to stay here."" The departure of Wilkins, who played for the club for six years, coupled with a poor run of form has put pressure on Ancelotti, even though Chelsea remain top of the Premier League table.

But he did his best to cook dinner each night and to spend quality time with his kids on weekends, and somehow, ""they ended up smarter than me,"" he jokes. Fast forward a few decades and Kizelewicz, now 63, is raising another family. He still makes dinner most nights but now he has a bigger home, a stable job and a wife whose additional income makes things much easier. Some people cautioned him against remarrying at 49, saying he was too old to start a new family. He had two complicated marriages behind him when his now-wife Natalie -- his son's coworker -- agreed to a date. He was 48 and dating for the first time since his children left the home; she was 29 and had just ended what she described as an emotionally abusive marriage to her first husband, with whom she had a daughter. She resisted at first because of the age difference, but when she finally gave in they immediately hit it off during their first date at Olive Garden. Now, 13 years and one child later, David and Natalie say they're happier than they ever were in their previous marriages. They know what they want from the relationship and from each other. Lifetime friendship is medicine for the soul . ""In your first marriage, you're starting out and struggling,"" said Kizelewicz, now a construction supervisor who lives north of Orlando. ""It's a lot easier to raise kids when you have money to raise them and give them the things they want."" It's been a long road to happiness. David Kizelewicz was married to the mother of his children and another woman after that, but both relationships ended in divorce. With this his third marriage and Natalie's second, in some ways the couple is beating the odds.

Nothing will divert us from day to day and now we only think of Cordoba.'

4bd729c4f4caefb2cf5760a7ef1f84aa26efce75,"(CNN) -- There's a big difference between a political debate about same-sex marriage and the recent hard-fought court challenge to the California ban, Proposition 8. In politics, anything goes: Vague, sinister comments about same-sex marriage threatening children or undermining the sanctity of heterosexual marriage were prevalent during the Prop 8 campaign. In court, same-sex marriage opponents needed solid evidence to back up these and other claims. Despite ""able and energetic counsel,"" they never produced it. That's why they lost, resoundingly, in the federal district court. And that lack of evidence should dog opponents up through the chain of appeals that is now beginning, because appellate courts are required to review only the evidence in the court record and to give great deference to Judge Vaughn Walker's findings of fact. He was there, after all, presiding over the trial, and the appellate judges weren't. And what a lopsided trial he presided over. All the anti-same-sex marriage arguments imploded when subjected to the rules of evidence. ""You don't have to have evidence of this point,"" counsel responded to the judge's question asking what support existed for their claim that ""responsible procreation is really at the heart of society's interest in regulating marriage."" No, sorry, at trial, you do have to have evidence. Of this point and every point. (And since -- as even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once pointed out in another case -- the sterile and elderly are allowed to marry, it can't be all about procreation.) Trials turn on admissible evidence -- primarily credible witness testimony or documents, in this type of case. And Prop 8 proponents did not have it. Over and over again, Walker's decision focused on the evidence, the mountain of reliable facts offered by gay marriage advocates, and the glaring lack thereof proffered by gay marriage opponents.

President Enrique Peña Nieto has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the disappearance of 43 college students, and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country. In September, a group of students boarded buses and vans bound for the nearby city of Iguala, intending to protest about a lack of funding for their school. They have not been heard from since. ""After Iguala, Mexico must change,"" Peña Nieto told a group of politicians and lawmakers. He proposed more than a dozen reforms, including a constitutional change that would give the state control over local police. The plan would be worked out in stages, starting with the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán and Tamaulipas, he said. The President also proposed setting up a nationwide emergency number, like 911 in the United States, and said he wants to boost development by creating three special economic zones in the country's impoverished south. Bodies found in southwestern Mexico .

Police haven't publicly identified the remains, and officials have not said whether there is any connection between the bodies and the September disappearances of the 43 students -- a case that has led to unrest over allegations that police abducted them, on order of a mayor, and turned them over to a gang that killed them. The 11 bodies were discovered near Chilapa, about an hour's drive west of Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers in Mexico's impoverished countryside.

Banks sold about 28,000 interest rate protection products to customers since 2001, the FSA said. Martin Wheatley, managing director of the FSA’s conduct business unit, said: 'For many small businesses this has been a difficult and distressing experience with many people’s livelihoods affected.' The claims echo the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal that emerged last year, costing banks billions of pounds, and come in the week Barclays was fined £290million for manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other. As well as offering redress directly for those customers that bought the most complex products, the banks have also agreed to stop marketing certain IRSA products to retail customers, the FSA said.

e12cf80babf8f05f529b92bf79058edfdb6ca093,"(CNN) -- Although much attention is currently focused on the cases before the U.S. Supreme Court in which same-sex marriage advocates seek to change the definition of marriage, another longtime priority of their movement has been to add ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" as protected categories in federal civil rights laws, through the so-called ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act"" (ENDA). Here, ""gender identity"" refers not to one's biological sex, but to whether one feels male or female. One concern about ENDA is its impact on religious liberty. ENDA would effectively forbid employers to consider sexual conduct in evaluating the character of their employees or applicants. Although ENDA contains a limited ""religious exemption,"" there remain serious questions as to whether any exemption would be adequate to meet the concerns of people with religious and moral scruples against homosexual conduct. However, focusing only on the religious exemption plays into the false assumption that religious or moral objections to homosexuality are the only reason why anyone objects to this law. What's most significant about it may not be its impact on homosexual workers or religious employers, or the controversial insistence by LGBT activists that it cover transgender people as well. What really matters is the ratcheting up of federal government interference in the free market. Opinion: No one should be fired for being gay . The basic claim of most of the advocates of ENDA is that discrimination is wrong if based on factors ""not relevant to job performance."" But again, the question is who decides what is ""relevant to job performance"" -- the individual employer, or the government? The strong presumption should be in favor of the employer. Of course, federal law already interferes with private employment decisions with regard to a few specific characteristics.

b6a77fee88742f800055709b367225903702d607,"(CNN) -- NASA says bad weather has forced it to put off the piggyback flight of the space shuttle Endeavour to California, where the now-retired spacecraft will be put on display. The space agency announced Sunday that it has pushed back the start of the multi-day flight until Tuesday, a day later than planned. Storms forecast over the Southeast prompted the delay, NASA said in a statement announcing the postponement. NASA still hopes to deliver Endeavour, the baby of the shuttle fleet, to Los Angeles by Thursday, the agency said. The spacecraft and its Boeing 747 carrier are slated to make several stops and low-level flyovers along the route, with overnight stops in Houston -- home to the mission control center for the U.S. manned space program -- and at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in southern California. Dryden is located at Edwards Air Force Base, the landing site for the first shuttle missions. The jet-shuttle combo will make low-altitude passes over NASA's Stennis Space Center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the agency's Michoud Assembly plant near New Orleans, where the shuttles' external fuel tanks were built; over the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, a last-resort landing site where shuttle pilots trained; and over San Francisco, Sacramento and other northern California sites. Endeavor is scheduled to be on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles by late October. Built as a replacement for the ill-fated shuttle Challenger, it made 25 flights into space between 1992 and 2011. The other two surviving orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, are also being put on display at museums. Atlantis will be at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Discovery at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum annex in Virginia.","NASA still hopes to deliver Endeavour to Los Angeles by Thursday.

Two of his predecessors from nearly 150 years ago, lawmakers representing the state of Connecticut in 1865, are seen voting against the constitutional amendment to end slavery. Courtney asked the Congressional Research Service for the records, and sure enough, all four representatives from Connecticut voted yes on the 13th amendment. But in the film, we see the fictional lawmakers Augustus Benjamin and Arthur Bentleigh of Connecticut each vote ""Nay."" ""I could not believe my own eyes and ears,"" Courtney said. In a letter of protest to director Steven Spielberg, he said that although he thinks overall the film is tremendous and compelling, ""placing the State of Connecticut on the wrong side of the historic and divisive fight over slavery is a distortion of easily verifiable facts."" Screenwriter Tony Kushner conceded the discrepancy but defended the film. ""None of the key moments of that story -- the overarching story our film tells -- are altered,"" he said in a statement Thursday. He explained that the alterations were made to serve the narrative that the outcome of the vote was in doubt until the very end. ""I hope nobody is shocked to learn that I also made up dialogue and imagined encounters and invented characters,"" he added. ""I'm sorry if anyone in Connecticut felt insulted by these 15 seconds of the movie,"" Kushner said, but ""this is a dramatic film and not an attack on their home state."" Still, Courtney said Friday that he hoped the movie would be changed before it is released on DVD on February 26. ""The four members of Connecticut's delegation ... deserved a better legacy than the screenplay portrayed,"" he said.

Dr Tin-Tse Lin, who presented the findings at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Amsterdam said risks were reduced with increased total or daily dosages of the drug. ‘Patients who received the highest total equivalent doses of statins had a three-fold decrease in the risk of developing dementia,’ it was found. ‘Similar results were found with the daily equivalent statin dosage.’ Researchers found that the dosage rather than solubility of potent drugs such as atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were responsible for their effectiveness. Almost every available version of the drug, except lovastatin, decreased the risk for new onset dementia when taken at higher daily doses. ‘Higher doses of high potency statins gave the strongest protective effects against dementia,’ said Dr Tin-Tse Lin.

The shot of 14-year-old Curtis D. Tucker shows him unrolling one of his birthday treasures in 1976, mouth slightly agape and eyes intensely focused on the gift. The present was one he had fervently requested from his parents and a hot item for many a young, red-blooded male during that bicentennial year: a poster of Farrah Fawcett (then known as Farrah Fawcett-Majors). ""I was a huge Farrah fan,"" said Tucker, now a cartoonist and entrepreneur living in Enid, Oklahoma. ""I had started collecting all of the magazines and pictures and I was basically pinning up every picture that came out of every magazine. Then along came that poster."" ""That poster"" reportedly became the best-selling of all time -- with more than 12 million copies sold -- and helped make Fawcett one of the last great pinups. A private funeral is scheduled Tuesday at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles, California, for the actress who died at the age of 62 from cancer. With her famously thick blond hair, red swimsuit, and smile as big and bright as the California sun, the actress was the epitome of the wholesome, all-American girl. ""She was full of life and so happy with that blond hair and that huge smile,"" said Tucker, who isn't sure if he still has the poster in his attic. ""Without that poster, I don't think she would have become what she was."" That freshness and beauty is what landed her poster on Tucker's, and countless others', bedroom walls. Maria Elena Buszek, the author of ""Pin-up Grrrls: Feminism, Sexuality, Popular Culture,"" said pinups ""straddled the line between portraiture and pornography"" and included early stage actresses, the famed models of Alberto Vargas and the most famous pinup of all, Bettie Page.

More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz. The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston. When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. ""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Friday. ""(But) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building, it was decided that we'd try to see if we could find it, investigate and see whether the box was still intact."" Hatchfield spent seven hours Thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it. ""The contents are of concern, but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition,"" Galvin said. According to Galvin, the box-shaped capsule was placed by the Revolutionary-era duo in 1795, a year when Adams was governor and when construction began on the State House and its iconic dome, which would eventually be overlaid with copper by Revere. Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure. ""It may contain other stuff, too,"" said Galvin. ""We don't know that yet."" But we might soon: Galvin, whose office is inside the State House, said the capsule's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week.

The 37-year-old man, who MailOnine is not identifying, said he has experienced strange symptoms for years, such as a dull ache after sex, but his concerns were always brushed aside by medics. Specialists have since discovered that, as well has having typical exterior male genitalia, he also has an interior uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. A 37-year-old businessman has been shocked to learn he has a fully functioning womb in addition to the typical male genitalia after suffering from a rare genetic disorder . They say he has been having periods since his teens, has experienced PMT, and may even be able to get pregnant. The man, from Lancashire, is now preparing for surgery to remove the womb having lived his whole life as a 'red blooded' male, according to The Sun. Doctors say this is the best way to treat the condition, but have warned him that he could start the menopause once the operation is complete. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a rare genetic disorder which occurs when the body fails to produce or respond to certain hormones while developing during pregnancy. Every foetus contains the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct, but if the baby is male then it will produce hormones meaning this reduces and then disappears all together. However in those with PMDS the body either does not produce these hormones, or does not react to them properly, meaning the duct develops into a functioning womb. Because these hormones do not affect the growth of the penis, it means the child will also develop typical exterior male genitals. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome is a genetic condition which means that both sets of genitals will form. Symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend, and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen .

The deadly crush happened Saturday in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began when people began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 511 were injured. Of these, 283 people had to be treated in hospitals, and all but 43 have been released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and said that she was ""horrified and saddened"" by the tragedy. Carsten Lueb of NTV said some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people they opened an additional event site. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 and at no time was it filled to capacity. NTV reported that 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event. Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure.

A man who intentionally infected his girlfriend with HIV has been jailed after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. Alan Mason, 45, from Endmoor, Cumbria, discovered he had HIV three years before he had unprotected sex with the woman, but still didn't bother to tell her, Carlisle Crown Court heard. Mason was jailed for two years and eight months by Judge Paul Batty QC, who told him: 'I am of the view that you deliberately targeted this hapless, vulnerable woman.'

When she began feeling ill while on holiday seven months later, her GP suggested she be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Prosecutor Alex Leach told the court that when she told Mason what the doctor had said, he broke down and told her he was HIV positive. He said that when a blood test later revealed that she, too, had HIV, she 'went into total shock' and thought she was going to die because of the 'alarming' amount of weight she lost, the Cumberland News reported.

""My guess is that when people hear about Al Jazeera, they will not be paying attention to the news quality or correspondents,"" said media analyst Stuart Fischoff, a retired professor at California State University at Los Angeles. ""They will just hear Qatar, and say it's an Arab country and it's full of terrorists and ... therefore bias in the news,"" he said. The Qatari government owns Al Jazeera. Others, however, may find any past political slants overshadowed by a newscast striving toward U.S. standards.

""I would like to say that if these words were truly spoken, then without a doubt, they do not reflect well on the future British monarch,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Thursday. The spokesman accused the royal family in general of using the media to smear Russia's involvement in the Ukraine crisis.

The birds -- most of which were dead -- were red-winged blackbirds and starlings, and they were found within a one-mile area of Beebe, about 40 miles northeast of Little Rock, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said. Birds fell over about a one-mile area, the commission said in a statement. As of Saturday, between 4,000 and 5,000 birds had been found dead, said Keith Stephens with the commission. ""Shortly after I arrived, there were still birds falling from the sky,"" said commission wildlife officer Robby King in the statement. He said he collected about 65 dead birds. The commission said it flew over the area to gauge the scope of the event, and no birds were found outside of the initial one-mile area. Karen Rowe, an ornithologist for the commission, said the incident is not that unusual and is often caused by a lightning strike or high-altitude hail. A strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day Friday. ""It's important to understand that a sick bird can't fly. So whatever happened to these birds happened very quickly,"" Rowe told CNN Radio on Sunday. ""Something must have caused these birds to flush out of the trees at night, where they're normally just roosting and staying in the treetops ... and then something got them out of the air and caused their death and then they fell to earth,"" Rowe added. Officials also speculated that fireworks shot by New Year's revelers in the area might have caused severe stress in the birds. Rowe said Sunday there was evidence that large fireworks may have played a role. ""Initial examinations of a few of the dead birds showed trauma.

The Low Pay Commission has recommended the increase to ministers, the largest real terms rise since 2007. Ministers boasted it would take the hourly rate to its highest level in real terms since 2010, but it falls short of the idea it could hit £7 floated by the Chancellor a year ago. The Low Pay Commission set out its recommendation for the main minimum wage rate to rise to £6.70 from October . The Commission recommends the adult rate should rise to £6.70 in October, while it would rise to £5.30  for 18-20-year-olds, £3.87 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.80 for apprentices. In an interview in January last year, Mr Osborne suggested it could go higher. ‘If the minimum wage had kept in line with inflation it would be £7,' he said. ‘Because we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’ The 20p rise is the largest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since 2007, and takes its real value three-quarters of the way back to its highest ever level. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This would represent an annual pay rise of £416 for a full time worker on the minimum wage. 'If this recommendation were accepted, the value of the minimum wage would be higher than when we came to office in 2010 and we are now making good progress towards restoring the value it lost during the financial crisis. 'I will now study these recommendations and consult my Cabinet colleagues with a view to announcing the final rates in the next few weeks.' Mr Cable said the Low Pay Commission had to strike a 'delicate balance' between what is fair for workers and what is affordable for employers, without costing jobs.

Brian Thomas Mettenbrink, 20, of Grand Island, Nebraska, was accused of participating in an attack orchestrated by a group that called itself ""Anonymous."" The group led protests against the church in various parts of the country before announcing in January 2008 that it would launch a cyber offensive, said Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Mettenbrink admitted in court that he downloaded software from an ""Anonymous"" message board and used it to launch ""denial of service"" attacks on Scientology Web sites. In such attacks, hackers flood a target site with so much traffic that it is unable to handle the volume and slows to a crawl or crashes altogether. As a result, the site is then unavailable to legitimate users. The group targeted the church after it forced Web sites to yank a leaked video of actor and church member Tom Cruise fervently making the case for Scientology. The video was intended for attendees at a church award ceremony in 2004 where Cruise was being honored. ""We are the authorities on getting people off drugs, we are the authorities on the mind, we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals,"" Cruise says in the video. In 2008, the video was leaked online and widely ridiculed. The church responded by threatening to sue Web sites unless they removed the clip. ""Anonymous"" then launched its attack. As part of its offensive, the group asked Internet users to not only download the ""denial of service"" software from its message board, but also to place prank phone calls, post proprietary church documents online, and send black pages to church fax machines to waste ink. The group posted a YouTube video that said it aimed to ""expel Scientology from the Internet."" ""Expect us,"" the video ended.

Documentary-makers in Germany have claimed that legalising prostitution has turned the country's capital Berlin into 'Europe's biggest brothel.' Sex trade laws were radically liberalised by the German government in 2002 but a documentary called Sex - Made In Germany estimates that one million men pay for sex every day. The film was based on two years of research captured using hidden cameras and explores Berlin's world of 'flat-rate' brothels where customers pay €49 (£42) for as much sex as they want. Sex for sale: Around a million men are paying for sex every day in Germany according to a new television documentary. Hamburg's Reeperbahn red light district is pictured. Laws were originally relaxed in the hope that they would offer a degree of protection to prostitutes who now have access to health insurance and benefits. But more than a decade on the changes in the law have brought criticism from those who claim that they have simply made it easier for traffickers to force foreign women into prostitution, according to The Guardian. It is thought that around two thirds of the country's 400,000 sex workers come from abroad. But according to figures from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) the number of reported cases of sexual trafficking in 2011 in Germany - 636 - were down by a third on a decade earlier. Red light districts have also become much more prominent in Germany's major cities - there are between 3,000 and 3,500 established brothels in Germany and the trade is now big business.

Claim: Merseyside PCSO Pauline Harrison is suing a property firm after injuring herself while on duty . A police community support officer is seeking £5,000 compensation from a property firm after she injured her knee while investigating a burglary. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft high wooden fence. The PCSO, who serves with Merseyside Police, said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport. The case will reignite controversy over the millions of pounds in compensation claims – fuelled by no-win, no-fee lawyers – made by police who are injured on duty every year. Last night Miss Harrison’s decision to sue was condemned by her own force. The incident happened in 2009 when she was called to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind, owned by property development firm Lightflask Ltd. Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds and the firm had secured the perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden 3ft fence closing off a gateway at the front  of the site. In court papers, Miss Harrison alleges Lightflask Ltd was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’. The former dog trainer also claims the company had failed to provide or make the wooden fencing safe, failed to properly warn the PCSO about the fencing, or erect warning signs. Miss Harrison also says there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site.

5878ed6740c035865d165309dc1ad82af99603c7,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes aimed at al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan have been ""very effective,"" with few civilian deaths as a result, CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday in a rare public acknowledgment of the raids. CIA Director Leon Panetta speaks about the fight against al Qaeda at the Pacific Council on International Policy. Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, ""but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage."" ""Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,"" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. ""I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,"" he said. But he said he believed al Qaeda leaders had come to view Pakistan's tribal regions as ""neither safe nor a haven."" Two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare, David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, wrote in The New York Times over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but Pakistani sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700.

Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, has warned that, for many people, their standards of living are falling . The Archbishop of York has warned of the growth of a 'new poor' who have jobs and work hard but still live in poverty. Dr John Sentamu, second in the hierarchy of the Church of England, told its General Synod that many people who previously enjoyed comfortable lifestyles were seeing their standard of living fall significantly. Such people - who he called 'the new poor' - feel they are going 'down the social scale' through no fault of their own, he said. 'Unlike the chief executives, many hard-pressed people find that they are on a 'down escalator',' he said. 'That phrase captures more than just a shortage of money - it adds a sense of descending the social scale.' Dr Sentamu added that many such people no longer believed that they could provide a better life for their children than they had enjoyed themselves. 'Formerly, each new generation enjoyed a higher standard of living than the previous one,' he said. 'That was the progress that everybody was taught to expect. It was a source of hope. 'But now the gains are being reversed. Many people believe their children will be worse off financially than they are.' He added that while 'once upon a time, you could not really be living in poverty if you had regular wages', this was 'no longer so'. Now, he said, 'you can be in work and still live in poverty', adding: 'Politicians often refer to hard-working families. They should speak instead of hard-pressed families.' Speaking in his presidential address to the Gerneal Synod - the parliament of the Church of England - Dr Sentamu said the annual salaries of chief executives of Britain's 100 largest companies 'reached an average of £4.3 million last year, or 160 times average wages'.

An Eton schoolboy was mauled to death by a polar bear while trekking through Norway after his team leaders used paper clips to secure the safety wire. Horatio Chapple, 17, was on a £2,500 adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands when a bear entered their camp, dragged him out of his tent, and killed him. Four others were severely injured before they managed to shoot the bear. Today, it emerged the trip-wire which should have alerted them when the bear approached had been secured by a paper clip. The alert system is designed to set off mines if an animal or intruder crosses the wire. But organisers of the British School Exploring Society trek in August 2011, which hosted 73 children, today admitted one of the wires was faulty and a team leader tried to fix it using the piece of stationery. The revelation comes at the start of an inquest into Horatio's death. A report published to coincide with the first day found the trip wires were inadequate, there should have been a bear watch, and the team should have been trained to use rifles. Sir David Steel, author of the report, blasted the 'inadequate' safety measures advised by Norwegian authorities, ruling that the incident 'was not unforeseeable'. He said teams should not be allowed to trek in the Arctic Circle without proper rifle training. And the team relied on an 'inconsistent' trip-wire system to alert them to the presence of polar bears - but it was inadequate as the warning would be too late. However, Richard Payne, from the BSES, defended the move, claiming it made the wire more effective. He said: 'The whole system is designed to give you an alert for you to wake up and do something about it. It's not a defence, it's not going to kill an intruder, it's going to alert you.'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said the vaccine series can be started as early as age 9. Twelve members of the committee voted in favor of a recommendation that 11- and 12-year-old boys be vaccinated; one member abstained. In a separate vote involving males age 13 to 21, eight voted in favor; five against, and one abstained. The same recommendation said men ages 22 through 26 may be vaccinated. Much of the debate focused on whether it would be cost-effective to vaccinate boys against HPV. The vaccine is administered over a six-month period in three doses, each of which costs about $120. Dr. S. Michael March, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California and a member of the group that devised the recommendations, said the cost to vaccinate 11- and 12-year-old boys would be $38 million.

Biden, known for making inappropriate slips of the tongue, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa lawmaker Neal Smith his 'butt buddy' while making remarks at Drake University. Butt buddy is a term that can mean two close friends who are considered inseparable. But it also has homosexual connotations. Oh, Joe: Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here on Wednesday at a White House event, appeared on Thursday to refer to a former Iowa congressman as his 'butt budy' In video posted to YouTube of the event, the gaffe-prone VP can be heard asking if his 'old butt buddy' Smith was in the crowd. 'Neal, I miss you man,' he added emphatically. 'I miss you.' A fellow Democrat, Smith served in the House while Biden was in the Senate. Smith, 94, is the longest serving member of the House of Representatives in Iowa's history, holding his seat from 1959 to 1995. Despite his self-proclaimed interest in seeking the presidency in 2016, Biden has stayed largely stayed away from media opportunities in the last several months after making a string of embarrassing verbal mistakes while on the campaign trail during the midterm elections. At another Iowa event, this one in September, Biden referred to the former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as 'the wisest man in the Orient.'

d5ea8c7ac1039d58b93b8aab26d656b4a081702c,"Cairo (CNN) -- Outside Egypt's top court in Cairo, protest leader Hussein Abdel Rahman wears a sash around his collared shirt emblazoned with a zucchini. The judiciary, he says, has transformed into what the green vegetable means in colloquial language: corruption, nepotism, favoritism. An editorial cartoon in a Cairo daily sums up Egypt's state of affairs: a scribbled mess of spirals. And the presidential election this weekend, once hailed as Egypt's big step toward democracy, is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The runoff vote is taking place after the Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliament invalid and triggered renewed chaos over the country's leadership. The ruling dealt a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood, which dominated parliament, and was victory for supporters of Shafik, the focus of protesters' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator. Anger festered Friday among those who feared that a hard-won revolution was fast unraveling; that little had changed. Rankled revolutionaries felt left out in the cold on a hot June day. The dissolution of parliament gives the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, or SCAF, full legislative and executive power alongside, it appears, a friendly judiciary.

A former town council clerk who masterminded a £1million scam from her office has been jailed for eight years. Janet Cooper spent the money on Mediterranean cruises, holidays with her husband in Devon, a £21,000 car and a box for council staff for a match at West Ham United. When the scale of her offending was uncovered she claimed to be blind and said she had no memory of events. The convicted fraudster - once the subject of a Channel 4 documentary - also carried a white stick and wore black glasses. After the hearing at Sheffield Crown Court, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stuart Hall said: 'There is no medical evidence to substantiate her blindness or memory loss.' Cooper was clerk at Brierley Town Council, near Barnsley, for three years. From the beginning of her time at the council she began pocketing a total of £295,000, which she siphoned off from £695,000 public works loans she dishonestly obtained. She used the money to go on holiday, buy a new Volvo and offered £375,000 cash on a four-bedroom bungalow, as well as spending £3,500 for a box at West Ham for council staff to see Barnsley play. She also claimed she was a Channel swimmer and collected sponsorship money. Sentencing her today to eight years in jail Judge Peter Kelson called Cooper 'pathologically dishonest'.

Rapist: Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, who was jailed for eight years for attacking a woman who was waiting for a bus home . A Romanian criminal who was deported eight years ago was able to come back to Britain and rape a woman at a bus stop. Homeless Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, was kicked out of the country in 2005 after an attack on a prostitute. But he returned this year, and within six months carried out a horrific drug-fuelled assault on a woman waiting for a bus  after a night out. The case raises worrying questions about border controls and how a convicted criminal was able to return to Britain. Last night, police launched an appeal for any other potential victims to come forward, warning that they ‘cannot rule out he has done this before’. Trimbitas was deported in 2005 following the conviction for false imprisonment of the prostitute, Woolwich Crown Court heard. He was given a two-year conditional discharge – effectively a slap on the wrist. But it is thought the nature of the offence, and the lack of proper punishment, meant his criminal record was not uploaded to border watch lists, allowing him to return in March this year. Last month, he targeted his 24-year-old victim after she left the Ministry of Sound nightclub near Elephant and Castle in South London. Sentencing him to eight years in jail, Judge Alice Robinson said the attack had a ‘devastating’ impact on the woman. Evidence: A shoe Marius Glad Trimbitas abandoned at the scene after being fought off by passers by who heard his victim's screams. Forensic tests were carried out linking him to the sex attack .

Jessica Padron of Nevada may have found the solution. After securing a prestigious unpaid student internship in the office of Senate leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, she has begun a crowdfunding appeal online. She is asking donors to help pay for her housing, transportation, and food, which she estimates will cost her $6,500 over the four months in the capital. ""If I don't reach my goal,"" she writes in her appeal, ""I will be forced to relinquish this opportunity and miss out on this once in a lifetime chance."" As of Tuesday, online donors had already chipped in enough for half of her costs. Some observers say there is some irony here, given that plenty of lawmakers are pushing to raise the minimum wage, yet don't pay a cent to some of their hardest workers. ""Of everybody in the federal government, only Congress is allowed to use unpaid interns,"" says Eric Glatt, a former unpaid intern who is now an activist with the Fair Pay Campaign. ""They have explicitly written an exemption for themselves into the law."" And it's not just Congress. Private employers in Washington and across the country can offer internships without pay. (Disclosure: CNN pays its interns.) Glatt warns that because only affluent students can afford to work for free, many students will be denied a crucial career experience. ""It is excluding the vast majority of people who cannot afford to work for free, or have their parents afford for their children to work for free,"" he said. ""It also promotes inequality."" Glatt worked for free as an intern on the movie ""Black Swan,"" but later successfully sued the movie studio, claiming that it was not fair that he was paid nothing.

On August 18, 2008, 10 French soldiers were killed when about 100 insurgents attacked a patrol in Kabul Province, and a British soldier was killed in southern Afghanistan when insurgents attacked a patrol with a roadside bomb. A month before that, 10 American troops were killed in two separate incidents on July 13, 2008. The latest deaths came as U.S. troops cranked up their fight against the Taliban, a push that includes a major Marine-led offensive against the militants in the southern province of Helmand. Roadside bombs Monday killed four Americans in the northern province of Kunduz and two in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. A seventh American died in an insurgent attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF confirmed.

Elephant calves are born with a lot of coarse hair on their heads and back, which they lose as they get older. It's not conclusively known why this head and back hair exists, although hair around the eyes and ears is usually for protection from elements and 'invading particles'. It could also provide an extra sense of touch to newborns, who rely heavily on their mother's presence for many years. It may just be a hangover of time in the womb. Elephant foetuses are covered in a felt of downy hair called 'lanugo'. Most of this is shed before birth.

059bf8dbd049f854a4c753150a783f9a35d503fb,"(CNN) -- Andy Carroll scored twice, his first goals for Liverpool, to help his club comfortably defeat Manchester City 3-0 in Monday's Premier League encounter at Anfield. City, who needed a victory to move above Chelsea into third place in the table, were blown away by a devastating first half performance from Liverpool, who have consolidated sixth position with this result. Liverpool began brightly and nearly took a seventh-minute lead when Luis Suarez's fine strike was tipped onto the post by City's England goalkeeper Joe Hart. But the visiting defense was struggling to cope with Liverpool's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when Carroll's superbly struck left-footed strike, from just outside the area, swerved past Hart for his first goal since joining the club for a British record transfer fee in January. Liverpool doubled their lead in the 34th minute when City failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots, the ball eventually falling to the feet of Dirk Kuyt who fired through the legs of defender Alexander Kolarov and past Hart. Liverpool made it 3-0 a minute later when Raul Meireles curled in an inviting cross from the left for Carroll to outjump Kolarov and help the ball into the far corner of the net. Liverpool had chances to increase their lead after the break but Hart did well to keep out efforts from Meireles and Kuyt, while Suarez fired wide from an acute angle and Carroll headed over the crossbar from a good position. City's defeat means they lie just three points ahead of Tottenham, who have a game in hand, in the race for the final Champions League place, with the teams still to play each other this season. A bad night for Roberto Mancini's side was made worse with the news that talismanic striker Carlos Tevez is now doubtful for Sunday's FA Cup semifinal against rivals Manchester United at Wembley, after limping off in the first half with a hamstring injury.",Andy Carroll scores twice as Liverpool defeat Manchester City 3-0 at Anfield.

They had just become a habit to Gadaffi. 'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.' Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'. He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.'

But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive . Now that there is research validity to these claims, the working world is starting to take notice.

""Yeah, well that's something that we have to work on, right? To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers, right? That's exactly right,"" Obama replied.

As a golfer, Michael Phelps is wondering what he's got himself into. ""It's one of the most humbling games I've tried to do in my entire life,"" the American tells CNN. ""I could always pick things up fairly easily, but I don't get how hitting a little object -- a little white ball, that isn't moving -- is so hard. ""Why can't I just hit this in a straight line? Or hook it, or draw it, or fade it -- I can't do it. I'm finally learning how to be able to do all that stuff and do it consistently. But I still do have some pretty bad shots."" Have a quick look online and you'll find Phelps hurling his driver away in disgust after embarrassingly topping his tee shot at the home of golf, St. Andrews in Scotland. ""Throwing clubs, using profanity -- everything comes out,"" Phelps says. But there are some moments of magic, such as when -- as a 26 handicapper -- he sank a monster 150-foot putt at the Dunhill Links pro-am in Scotland last October. However, golf requires both power and precision -- which Phelps, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child, is slowly learning to combine. ""He's one of those players that people would look at and say, 'He has a lot of potential.' What that technically means is that the player is very long and very wild,"" says Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney, who has been tutoring Phelps in the latest series of his television show The Haney Project. ""They never look at someone who hits it a very short distance and say, 'Oh you've got a lot of potential.' They always comment on the potential someone has as based solely on the distance of their hitting.""

a0c78018314da7dec7c9789965ab3845bc196fe0,"(CNN) -- Greece's elections this weekend could trigger the country's exit from the euro -- but even that might not save Europe from splintering, the head of insurance giant AXA has warned. Henri de Castries told CNN ""a Greek exit won't solve everything,"" adding the problems in Europe are ""more complex than that."" De Castries, a fan of Greek mythology, believes a Greek exit would be akin to opening a Pandora's box. ""Opening the box is very tempting before and very disastrous afterwards,"" he said. De Castries said there were ""flaws"" in the construction of the euro which have created the cracks. ""It was a case of putting the cart before the horse,"" he said. ""Economic policies were not converging enough and the disciplines were not strong enough to allow for a stable position in the long run."" The worst-case scenario, according to de Castries, would be a disorderly default by Greece leading to its collapse out of the euro. Further, Italy and Spain could suffer bank runs that could exacerbate the bloc's pain. However, such an outcome could be avoided should a moderate party win a majority in the Greek elections, securing the country's future in the eurozone, he said. De Castries points to the Spanish banking crisis as one which must be resolved so Europe can allay concerns about the strength of its firewalls. ""We need to be sure that we don't just have the fire brigade,"" he said, ""but that water is coming out of the pipe. The Spanish case is a good test for that."" AXA, the second-biggest insurer in Europe, has been offloading its investments in Greek debt -- at a 78% write-down -- and no longer buys Italian and Spanish debt, as it seeks to distance itself from the deepening crisis. De Castries said the company's investment portfolio is being kept diverse: ""We have approximately 80% of our assets in bonds, of which half or a little less are in sovereign bonds. The other half is in corporate bonds and 20% are in other asset classes such as equities and real estate,"" he add",Henri de Castries says a Greek exit would be akin to opening a Pandora's box.

6a4506b327b5d820649d0264e4207ce2fef82c51,"(CNN) -- We are losing in Afghanistan, on two fronts. The most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the Taliban well recognizes -- is the American public. And now, most Americans are opposed to the war. For years, Afghanistan was ""the forgotten war,"" and when Americans started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of President Obama's inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight: a corrupt Afghan government, a world-class drug trade, a resurgent Taliban and steadily rising U.S. casualties. Many surely thought: Didn't we win this war eight years ago? Americans, of course, hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat, but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing, which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the Iraq war in 2006. Within a couple of years, Iraq came back from the brink and started to turn around, after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most Americans. Similarly, the American public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in Afghanistan if they saw real progress being made there. And right now, they don't. The second front we're losing is the Afghans themselves, who are the United States' center of gravity in the Afghan war. Eight years into this conflict, America and its NATO allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of Afghans -- are not providing large swaths of the Afghan population with the most basic public good, which is security. It's time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about ""connecting the Afghan people to the government"" -- Afghans have never had, and don't expect much, in the way of services from their government, and it's time now to focus on something much more basic: security.

American football star Mark Duper has been released from jail on bond after allegedly beating up his 17-year-old son in a domestic row. The former Miami Dolphins player faces a felony child abuse charge after assaulting his teenage son and knocking him out during a series of fights at their Florida home. The wide receiver, who starred for the Dolphins from 1982 to 1992, spent a night in jail after his arrest on Wednesday following the assault the day before. Authorities say Duper attacked his son Marcus three times and knocked him out twice. Duper has reportedly admitted there was an altercation but said he was acting in self-defense. It was reported that the argument began with a row over a text Duper's son had sent to an ex-girlfriend. During the row, Duper allegedly asked his son to pick a hat off the floor and punched him in the face when he 'wouldn't listen', according to the arrest report quoted in the Miami Herald. The report claims Duper picked his son up and body-slammed him, knocking him unconscious. The fight is then said to have calmed down before escalating again, with Duper allegedly 'hitting the child in the head and face with his fist'.

7656fc745a1ba6ea6cba65f54011ec5fa3ea862b,"(CNN) -- What started as a deeply emotional race for Tony Stewart ended prematurely when a blown tire cut short his return to NASCAR. Stewart came back to competition Sunday for the first time since his car struck and killed another driver on August 9. The crowd at the Oral-B USA 500 erupted in cheers as Stewart was introduced. But after just 172 of 325 laps at the Atlanta Motor Speedway, his front right tire blew, and Stewart's car smacked the wall on Turn 2. In the end, Kasey Kahne won the race and clinched a spot in the ""Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup"" playoff. Matt Kenseth came in second, and Denny Hamlin finished third. But many thoughts were with Stewart and Kevin Ward Jr., the 20-year-old driver who was killed at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York. Stewart declined to speak to a reporter after Sunday's race. But he spoke to the media briefly Friday about Ward's death. ""This has been one of the toughest tragedies I've ever had to deal with, both professionally and personally,"" Stewart said. ""And this is something that will definitely affect my life forever."" Ward's death . Spectator video from the night of Ward's death shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Authorities said Ward died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Stewart withdrew from the NASCAR race in New York's Watkins Glen the day after Ward died. He also missed races in Michigan and Tennessee.

d08a184661c20e3ab4aa455d031b334e4d8d0768,"(CNN) -- Two of the most influential papers for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire -- the first two states to weigh in at the polls in 2008 -- both endorsed John McCain in the Republican presidential race, but differed in their choice in the Democratic contest. The Des Moines Register backs Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picks Barack Obama. The Des Moines Register backed Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picked Barack Obama, in excerpts of Sunday's editorials posted on their papers' Web sites Saturday night. The Iowa caucuses are January 3, and New Hampshire's primary follows five days later. The Globe's editorial board dismissed concerns over the Illinois senator's relative lack of Washington experience. ""It is true that all the other Democratic contenders have more conventional resumes, and have spent more time in Washington,"" the board wrote. ""But that exposure has tended to give them a sense of government's constraints. Obama is more open to its possibilities."" But the Register's editorial board -- which noted that Obama ""demonstrates the potential to be a fine president"" -- still gave the edge to the senator from New York, saying it made the nods in both parties' primaries based on competence and readiness to lead. ""When Obama speaks before a crowd, he can be more inspirational than Clinton,"" the board wrote. ""Yet, with his relative inexperience, it's hard to feel as confident he could accomplish the daunting agenda that lies ahead."" The Iowa paper's endorsement is widely viewed as a major boost for Clinton, and a blow to the campaign of former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, whose Register endorsement during the 2004 race was followed by a surprisingly strong showing in the state's Democratic caucuses. Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN's Mike Roselli that the campaign was ""not surprised"" by the Register's decision, adding ""that it was a bigger surprise to get the Globe's,"" and noting that the Des Moines paper ""said good things about us.""

Bama County is famous in China for the longevity of its residents. The 2000 census recorded 74 centenarians, a surprisingly large number considering the total population is only 238,000. The ratio of centenarians there is 30.8 per 100,000, far exceeding the international standard of 25 per 100,000 for 'hometowns of longevity' - centenarian-clustered areas recognised by the International Natural Medicine Society.

The head of the watchdog monitoring MPs’ expenses is being paid up to £169,000 a year in an ‘off-payroll’ deal allowing her to reap huge tax benefits, it can be revealed. Paula Higson, acting chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), earns the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company. Ipsa, set up in 2009 in the wake of the MPs’ parliamentary expenses scandal, states that its main duty is ‘to serve the interests of the public’. However, it pays Mrs Higson in a deal allowing her to save thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax – while Ipsa cuts its own national insurance payouts. Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander condemned similar ‘off-payroll’ arrangements saying they aided ‘tax avoidance’. Mrs Higson, who runs a private consultancy business, declined an opportunity to outline her tax payments. Ipsa also refused to give more details – even though its own website details staff expenses as small as a a ‘fruit basket’ worth £20. Mrs Higson is already familiar with ‘off-payroll’ deals. After leaving her last salaried job, earning £110,000 a year as chief operating officer at NHS Direct, she switched to working on contract at the same employer for £132,000 a year. The arrangement would have slashed her own national insurance and income tax liability. Miss Higson, who lives in a £1million house in Twickenham, west London, also appears to be continuing to be available for other work  while being paid to monitor MPs’ expenses, with her website fully operational.

4878b1b3ce21e1e9456bc71b67111f5d2bb63f3e,"Washington (CNN) -- Union leaders, the White House and congressional Democrats have agreed to limit the reach of a tax on high-end health insurance plans that would help pay for a proposed overhaul of the U.S. health care system, union leaders involved in the talks said Thursday. The proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $23,000 to $24,000 for families and from $8,500 to $8,900 for individuals, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters. Dental and vision benefits won't be counted toward that amount after 2014, he said. Health plans covered by union contracts would not be subject to the 40 percent tax until 2018 -- a transition period union leaders said is comparable to those offered to other private insurers. The threshold for taxing other plans will be adjusted by 1 percent above the annual rate of inflation, and plans involving large numbers of women or the elderly will get breaks as well, Trumka said. The changes will reduce the $150 billion expected to be raised over 10 years by about $60 billion, he said. And union plans would be able to enter the health care exchanges set up under the bill in 2017, he said. The tax on what have been dubbed ""Cadillac"" health care plans is a key feature of the Senate health care bill, but it has drawn opposition from Democrats in the House of Representatives and from unions. President Obama, who has made health care his top priority in Congress, supports the excise tax as a way to contain the rise of health-care costs. Trumka and other top  union officials have held a series of talks at the White House for the past three days as congressional negotiators tried to merge the two bills together. He warned earlier this week that congressional Democratic candidates could risk losing labor's support if the final bill included a tax on high-cost health plans. But he said that despite all-but-total Republican opposition in both houses of Congress, supporters of health care reform stood ""on the threshold o","The proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $23,000 to $24,000.

We need to move away from dirty, dangerous and deadly energy sources. We are pleased that the White House is now saying it will suspend any new offshore drilling while the explosion and spill are investigated, but there should be no doubt left that drilling will only harm our coasts and the people who live there. Taking a temporary break from offshore drilling is an important step, but it's not enough. We need to stop new offshore drilling for good, now. And then we need an aggressive plan to wean America from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades. This BP offshore rig that exploded was supposed to be state-of-the-art. We've also been assured again and again that the hundreds of offshore drilling rigs along our beaches are completely safe. Now, we've seen workers tragically killed. We've seen our ocean lit on fire, and now we're watching hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic oil seep toward wetlands and wildlife habitat. This rig's well is leaking 210,000 gallons of crude every day, wiping out aquatic life and smothering the coastal wetlands of Louisiana and Mississippi. As the reeking slick spreads over thousands of square miles of ocean, it rapidly approaches the title of worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, even worse than 1989's Exxon Valdez oil spill. The well is under 5,000 feet of water, and it could take weeks or even months to cap it. This disaster could unfortunately happen at any one of the hundreds of drilling platforms off our coasts, at any moment. It could happen at the drilling sites that the oil industry has proposed opening along the beaches of the Atlantic Coast. Indeed, even before this spill, the oil and gas industry had torn apart the coastal wetlands of the Louisiana Bayou over the years. These drilling operations have caused Louisiana to lose 25 square miles of coastal wetlands,","We need an aggressive plan to wean America from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades.

Police believe the DNA belongs to the killer. They just don't know who he is. They are waiting for a match. From the beginning, police focused their attention on Patsy Ramsey, placing the entire family under what authorities later would admit was a cloud of suspicion. The investigators' working theory was that JonBenet's mother may have struck her in anger as punishment for bed-wetting, causing the little girl's death on Christmas night.

a61a99502a2576efe2eedb79f6687916badff7d2,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Disneyland employee pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony possession of a destructive device in a public place during an incident where two water bottles with dry ice exploded in the theme park, authorities said Thursday. Christian Isaiah Barnes, 22, of Long Beach, California, was arraigned Thursday, and his bail was set at $500,000, said Farrah Emami, a spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. His next court date is a pretrial hearing on June 7, Emami said. The charge against Barnes carries a maximum prison sentence of six years, the district attorney's office said in a statement. Barnes, an employee at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, allegedly possessed two water bottles containing dry ice -- which can make for a destructive device called a dry ice bomb, the prosecutor's office said. The devices caused small explosions in Disneyland, authorities said. On Tuesday, Barnes was being relieved of his shift at a Disneyland vending cart outside Mickey's Toontown, prosecutors said. When Barnes opened the vending cart, the first water bottle with dry ice exploded, the prosecutor's statement said. Then Barnes allegedly took the second water bottle from the cart and, as he walked to the employee break room through Toontown, allegedly placed it in a trash can, prosecutors said. Barnes allegedly left the area, and a custodian removed the trash bag and placed it on the ground, prosecutors said. The custodian walked away from the bag to clear another trash can, and then the water bottle in the bag exploded, authorities said. Visitors were cleared from Toontown for about two hours as authorities investigated, though the rest of Disneyland remained open.

ee332df3e3fa59d63b00e480d25e76eb76d37bd9,"(EW.com) -- Millions of ""Game of Thrones"" fans are feeling sadness, outrage, and, sure, some perverse excitement after watching Sunday's episode titled ""The Rains of Castamere."" But for Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, such reactions to ""The Red Wedding"" are nothing new. Martin has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous Tully-Frey union for more than a decade, ever since he published his Song of Ice and Fire saga's third novel, A Storm of Swords. Below, the author reveals why Robb had to die, gives his reaction to upset readers and spills the scene's horrifying real-life inspiration. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How early in the process of writing the book series did you know you were gonna kill off Robb and Catelyn? George R.R. Martin: I knew it almost from the beginning. Not the first day, but very soon. I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do. Since Song of Ice and Fire so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures, should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending? As The Boy recently said on Thrones, ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."" I've stated numerous times that I anticipate a bittersweet ending. EW: What sort of reactions have you received from readers over the years about the scene? Extreme. Both positive and negative. That was the hardest scene I've ever had to write. It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it. So the ent","George R.R. Martin has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous Tully-Frey union.

Julie Patz came face-to-face with Pedro Hernandez, the former shop worker accused of killing the six-year-old boy when she testified at Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday. She told the jury he was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when she talked about her feelings when she realized her son was missing. Her testimony is the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened.

Family support: Shira Patz, Etan's sister (center) and Stan Patz, his father, arrive at court for the second day of Pedro Hernandez's murder trial . Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little. Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979 — the first time he walked to school alone. 'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.' Julie Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking.

'This woman is still in the country. She will not escape if she passes through exit points at the border because of her fingerprints. ‘We are confident we are looking for the white widow.'

Three G4S detainee custody officers are to be charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of Jimmy Mubenga, the Crown Prosecution Service said today. Mubenga, 46, was on a British Airways flight bound for his native Angola when security guards noticed he was not breathing. The father-of-five later died in hospital. Officers Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig will now be charged with manslaughter after earlier inquest found that Mr Mubenga had been 'unlawfully killed' during his deportation. The G4S guards had been tasked with removing Mr Mubenga on a British Airways flight to his native Angola in October 2010. The inquest found Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing. Prosecutors decided in July 2012 that no charges should be brought in relation to Mr Mubenga’s death. The case was reconsidered by the CPS after the inquest last year recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

Just last month, the grandmother of two inked a contract with IMG models, the agency that represents Amazons such as Gisele, Kate Moss and Lily Cole. Already this year, Shanghai-born Machado has bagged the front cover of New York Magazine. ""Can you imagine?"" she laughs over the phone from New York. ""You know, I never dreamt this in my whole life!"" She also features in luxury store Barney's Fall ad campaign, styled by former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld, alongside the likes of Naomi Campbell and Crystal Renn. In the past few weeks, she shot a fashion spread for Vogue -- ""Italian ... or Spanish Vogue, I can't remember"" -- with photographer Bruce Weber, which will feature in the coming months. ""(It's) of me -- with all these 20-year-olds he always photographs,"" she says. Not that she's phased -- breaking the mould is nothing new for Machado. Machado had started modelling in Paris in 1954 for Givenchy and Balenciaga and claims to have been the highest paid catwalk model of her time. Her big break came in 1958. Oleg Cassini, who would later become known for designing First Lady Jackie Kennedy's state wardrobe in the 1960s, spotted Machado in Paris and offered her a contract to come to New York to model one of his collections. The rest is history. ""The day I arrived I met Diana Vreeland (legendary fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue) and she introduced me to (Richard) Avedon,"" remembers Machado. She became Avedon's muse, working with him exclusively for three years -- and in 1959, Machado was the first non-Caucasian model to feature on the cover of a fashion magazine, gracing the front of Harper's Bazaar in an image shot by legendary photographer Richard Avedon.

Staff at GP practices across the country have been provided with a ‘common sense’ guide to dealing with patients suspected of having Ebola. The step-by-step advice, provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners, has been designed to minimise the risk of the infection spreading in the event it reaches the UK. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the country to expect a 'handful' of cases by Christmas. The guidance, presented in the form of an index card, has been designed to ensure that patients receive the best and fastest care possible whilst protecting practice teams from possible contamination. It is tailored to individual members of GP practice teams, including receptionists and telephone call handlers, practice managers, and duty doctors. Each 'Ebola Action Card' outlines their specific duties and responsibilities if a patient arrives with Ebola-type symptoms or rings the surgery for advice. Patient advice is also included, with recommendations for what to do if they are in a GP practice or at home. Any patient who arrives with a potential case of Ebola will be told to go to an isolation room and will then be assessed by the duty doctor over an internal phone system. If Ebola is a serious possibility, doctors are asked to alert an infectious-disease specialist at the nearest hospital. Compiled by Dr Simon Stockley, a GP from Stockton-On-Tees, the cards provide a practical and common-sense approach to the current crisis, as well as much-needed reassurance for staff and patients in general practice. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the UK should expect a 'handful' of Ebola cases by Christmas .

74425d99530b0a1f4f29c8fb547756d435da884a,"Plastic banknotes which can survive a hot 90-degree washing machine cycle could arrive in Britain within three years, the Bank of England said yesterday. In a break with tradition, the Bank is considering ditching the current £5 and £10 notes – which are made from cotton paper –and replacing them with ones made from polymer. The new notes last for more than twice as long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear. The Bank of England could introduce polymer £5 and £10 notes (pictured) within three years that can survive a spin in a washing machine . The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability. A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday. Plastic notes were introduced in Australia in 1988 to try and stop counterfeiting. They are due to be issued in New Zealand, Romania, Mexico and Vietnam and current Governor of the Bank of England introduced them in his native Canada. A special one-off plastic £5 was previously issued in Northern Ireland to commemorate the Millennium. The bank says the introduction of plastic notes will save about £10million a year as they will not have to be replaced so often. Polymer £5 notes will measure 125mm by 65mm, smaller than the current note. Supporters of polymer notes say they are more hygienic, harder to tear and more difficult to counterfeit. But critics say they stick together and are slippery. And . they can also be recycled to create items including plant pots and . garden furniture – a move which is likely to please Diana Carney, the . wife of the new Bank governor and a committed environmentalist.

The prolific writer shares parenting stories in ""You Can Date Boys When You're Forty: Dave Barry on Parenting and Other Topics He Knows Very Little About."" He has written more than 30 books, but this is the first that headlines his role as a parent. Despite the title, Barry explains, it's not purely a parenting book. ""I wouldn't want anybody to think that this is a book where they're going to learn useful information about parenting,"" he said. ""Or, really, anything else."" Like many of his books, this is a collection of essays sharing his opinions on a wide range of issues and experiences.

Barry received a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his nationally syndicated humor column. For nearly 30 years, he has lived in Miami, which has provided plenty of fodder for his fiction and nonfiction books. ""If you want to write humor, just come here,"" he said.

'They observed the car coming to a complete stop, racing off at speed and mounting a kerb twice.'

Attorney Francis Lawrence, in his opening statement, contended that would be appropriate because the death was an accident. George Huguely currently faces charges including first-degree murder in the death of Yeardley Love, who also was a lacrosse player for the university. University of Virginia law professor Darryl Brown told InSession that involuntary manslaughter in the state carries a maximum 10-year sentence. Huguely has been held for two years. But prosecutors, in their opening statement, said Huguely made an e-mail threat against Love, 22, before her May 2010 death. Prosecutor Warner D. Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely learned Love had allegedly slept with someone else. The defendant wrote, ""I should have killed you"" and Love responded, ""You should have killed me?"" according to Chapman. Huguely responded that the pair should talk, Chapman said. Chapman also told jurors Love's death was slow and painful and that she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. The defense also claims Love was alive when Huguely left. Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."" But defense attorney Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall. Lawrence said Huguely refused to believe Love was dead when questioned by police.

16725f066cbac895cebf70fa8fa3ef814322610e,"Fearful: Popular Commons Speaker George Thomas dreaded interest in his sexual proclivities . The row over claims of an establishment cover-up of an alleged paedophile ring took a new turn last night over fresh claims concerning former Commons Speaker George Thomas. When late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a Westminster child sex ring in the 1980s, Thomas, who was in the Speaker’s chair at the time, had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality. Furthermore, The Mail on Sunday has been told of claims that Thomas, who later became Viscount Tonypandy, propositioned young men in the Speaker’s official grace and favour apartment in Parliament. A senior political source said: ‘Thomas had an interest in young men and did not hide it at Westminster.’ In the 1960s, Thomas was a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases, including Dickens’S dossier in the 1980s. And he reportedly used his Home Office position to help Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe – who was later acquitted of attempted murder of his gay lover – to cover up an alleged homosexual offence against a minor. The disclosures follow the announcement of official inquiries into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring and a Home Office cover-up. Thomas, who died in 1997, was one of Britain’s best-loved and most influential public figures as Speaker from 1976 to 1983. A Methodist lay preacher, he was a Home Office Minister in Harold Wilson’s Labour Government and joined the Cabinet. As Speaker, he had unrivalled power, including control of Commons debates, security and disciplining MPs and even reading the lesson at Prince Charles’s 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer.

Volunteers cooked up quarter-pounders using three minced carcasses each, and one triumphed with a 'cajun melt' surprise - complete with a mozzarella and chutney topping. But they were criticised by vegetarian groups who said grey squirrels were being unfairly maligned, while the RSPCA issued a warning over how the animals were caught.

Only 6 per cent of those questioned would trust the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove . Parents are concerned about the effect the Government is having on their child's education, a poll suggests. Around one in 12 (8 per cent) parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact on the education system since it took power, while almost half (44 per cent) said the impact has been negative. The survey of around 2,000 adults, commissioned by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), indicates that the majority would entrust their child's education to school leaders. Asked who, other than themselves, they trust the most to educate their son or daughter, more than half (59 per cent) of those questioned said head teachers, followed by the local authority (16 per cent) and school governors (13 per cent). Around 6 per cent said they would trust the Secretary of State for Education, a post currently held by Michael Gove, and the same proportion said they would trust an academy chain. The poll also reveals that just 2 per cent believe politicians should be able to prescribe what teachers teach, while a third (35 per cent) said teachers should be able to exercise their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils. The survey comes as the NUT meets for its annual conference in Liverpool. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The fact that only 8 per cent of parents think that the Government has had a positive impact on the education system is very significant.' She added: 'It appears that it is now only the Secretary of State who believes that his policies are taking education in the right direction. Michael Gove's proposals for examination reform, the national curriculum and academies and free schools are all being questioned.'

Days later Belgium intelligence services smashed a suspect Islamist plot to kill a police officer or judge. The militant then saves his most personal attack for the Kurdish leader Masoud Barazani, who is currently leading the fight against ISIS in Iraq.

It'll be a tough challenge for us but we're looking forward to it,' the Argentina goalkeeper told the club's official website. 'We've been creating a lot, especially against Villa, and we hope to do that against Tottenham too. Any point away from home is always a good point but if you go into games with that mentality then you tend to lose.

At 4 months old, Kaden is a playful, black- and white-coated basenji being schooled at Georgia K9 National Training Center.

Demand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement.

However Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, which all have strong academic records, did better. The rankings, based on a test taken by 85,000 pupils across 44 jurisdictions, show that English teenagers are better at solving real-life problems – such as adjusting a thermostat or selecting the cheapest rail tickets – than they are at tackling academic subjects. England is one of only a handful of countries where teenagers are better at problem-solving than maths, reading and science. Boys did slightly better than girls in the test - a reversal of the picture seen in national GCSE exams taken a year later . Boys did slightly better than girls, in a reversal of the picture seen in national GCSE exams taken a year later. Experts said the finding suggested GCSEs may be ‘unfair’ to boys.

It is the gentle Sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones.

The audience was told to phone in ‘any time’ with romantic song choices and messages, without an explanation the show’s script was finalised three days earlier. It meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point. They also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show, broadcast between 9am and 11am every Sunday. The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience. It upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer Andy Williams had been recorded before his death. The show is recorded on Fridays, but the playlist and script are decided each Thursday, meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show. An answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request. The BBC amended the on-air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call.

The race will be run at a refurbished 4.421-kilometre Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit in Mexico City. A date has yet to be finalized. Tavo Hellmund, organizer of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas and co-founding partner of the new Mexican Grand Prix said he was ""delighted"" a deal had been reached. ""Ever since Bernie and I began working on a race at Austin, it's been a dream of mine to help Formula One return to Mexico,"" said Hellmund. ""This announcement has therefore been years in the making, but we've gradually been able to assemble all the right pieces. I'm absolutely delighted,"" he added. Force India driver Sergio Perez, one of two Mexican drivers currently on the grid, also hailed the news. ""The return of F1 to our country is a sign that the Mexican state can achieve anything."" Perez wrote on his official website. ""It's a great opportunity to show the world what Mexico is and what we are capable of achieving. We're big and when we have the same tools as our competitors, we are the best in the world."" His compatriot and Sauber driver Esteban Gutierrez also tweeted his approval. Perez was two years old when Britain's Nigel Mansell won the last F1 race in Mexico in 1992. Mexico hosted official F1 racing for eight years between 1963 and 1970.

7733e8717a94bd845dcd51509881108dca6d1821,"(CNN) -- World No.1 Victoria Azarenka lived up to her to billing with a tenacious three set victory over Maria Sharapova to reach the U.S. Open final against 14-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams who dispatched Italy's Sara Errani in two sets late Friday. Azarenka recovered from a set and a break down to win a grueling battle against the Russian third seed after two hours 42 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. The Belarus star had continuously pressed on the Sharapova service in the decider and finally made the breakthrough in the 10th and final game. A first match point was saved by 2006 champion Sharapova, but reigning Australian Open champion Azarenka worked another opening with more determined play to win the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. ""To come back was pretty difficult because Maria is a terrific fighter,"" she told Sky Sports after her win. ""I just had to try to stay focused and when I had the opportunity I had to set it up,"" she added. Azarenka will take on Serena Williams in the final after the American made fast work of her semi-final defeat of Italy's Sara Errani. Williams knocked out underdog Errani in just over one hour, 6-1, 6-2. ""I just try first set to be a bit more on the defense, to receive a bit more far away, and play her high balls and try to make that game -- then was not so good, so I changed and try to be a bit more aggressive,"" said the 25-year-old Errani. ""In any case, it was very difficult,"" she added. Wiliams is the only player left in the women's 2012 singles draw not to have dropped a set, matching the record of men's defending champion Novak Djokovic. In last year's U.S. Open, Williams beat Azarenka in the third round, 6-1, 7-6 (5). The fourth seed has a 9-1 head-to-head advantage against the Belarussia over the course of the careers, including wins in the 2012 Wimbledon and Olympic semifinals.

The unidentified victim says she connected with Carey, who attended her school, on Facebook about a week before he played a hockey game in town. On Valentine's Day, the victim and a girlfriend met with Carey and his hockey friends at the local Days Inn motel after a game against the Fargo Force. The victim told police detectives that she had sex with Carey in one of the motel rooms, while Smith was present. Two days later, she started receiving text messages from other hockey players and girls saying 'nice video'. She suspected Smith took video of the tryst and confronted him, but Smith said it was Carey who took the video.

02a2af5abc2c9b140b8ded1f73daf85fb75ed1e0,"Alastair Cook will be 30 on Christmas Day and should be able to celebrate his landmark birthday as England's World Cup captain. After a 'hell of a year', though, he will be taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider - as they have promised - all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before announcing a 16-man tri-series squad on Saturday. Cook conceded after the margin of his fifth successive one-day international series defeat was confirmed on Tuesday as 5-2, by an 87-run trouncing at Colombo's Premadasa Stadium, that he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Alastair Cook has endured a horrible series as England captain this winter in Sri Lanka . He can be encouraged, however, by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton's strong hint that - despite his 'miserable' run of form - he is highly likely to retain the gig. For Cook, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - because however England fare down under, with or without him, it is hard to envisage him being back for much more with his sheet-anchor skills in a fast-developing format. Downton also described 2014 as a 'traumatic' 12 months as he reflected on his tenure - which began at the start of January, as England were completing their unexpected whitewash Ashes defeat. One crisis after another followed, the messy aftermath of the Ashes including the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and resignation of coach Andy Flower. As Cook and Flower's replacement, the returning Peter Moores, tried to forge a 'new era', the captain especially endured the most taxing of summers as calls for his resignation started to wane only once England turned round their Test fortunes en route to a 3-1 win over India. After Tillekaratne Dilshan's century had helped to inflict England's final defeat of 2014, Cook said: 'It's been a hell of a year.

The scanners are among a display of the latest new security equipment being showcased at the week-long Farnborough International Air Show where organisers have created a realistic mock-up check-in security zone and departure lounge containing the new devices. It is the latest technology – much of it still secret –  developed to help combat the anticipated growing terror threat in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics and beyond. The airport security stand allows the show’s expected quarter of a million visitors  to experience a practical ‘walk-through’ test of new technology from the moment a passenger arrives at check-in to deposit hold luggage before going through security with or without carry-on hand baggage. The radiation detectors are an example of some of the most sophisticated technology to be developed for security purposes. They scan unwary passengers for traces of radioactivity to deter attacks from a ‘dirty bomb’ whose contamination effects could last for years. The radiation detection unit sits near the top of the 3ft high 2.5 inch diameter pole,  just beneath the roll-out extendable belt mechanism. The battery to power it sits in the weighted base. It can send warnings wirelessly via wi-fi to a central control unit. Poles can be linked via wi-fi to track a suspect emitting radiation.

76bd98248737472cbbb0cbe07d1486131ebc079a,"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande voiced anger Wednesday over the confession by his former budget minister that he had a secret Swiss bank account, and affirmed that the man had not been shielded from justice. Jerome Cahuzac resigned as minister in March, two months after prosecutors launched a preliminary investigation into suspected tax evasion. It was not until a meeting with the investigating judges on Tuesday that he finally confessed he held the undeclared Swiss bank account, a statement on his blog said. Hollande said Cahuzac had made an ""unforgivable mistake"" that was an insult to the country. ""Yesterday I was both stupefied and angry when I was informed of Jerome Cahuzac's confession to the judges,"" the president said. ""He misled the highest authorities of the country: the head of state, the government, the parliament, and through it the French people as a whole."" Hollande said the full truth will be established. ""The judicial system will play its role to the end and with complete independence,"" he said. ""I hereby affirm that Jerome Cahuzac did not benefit from any protection apart from that of the presumption of innocence. And he left the government at my request from the moment a judicial inquiry started."" Hollande vowed that steps will be taken to bolster the independence of the judiciary, to help it ""fight mercilessly"" against conflicts of interest. He also promised tougher penalties for any elected officials found guilty of fraud or corruption. The claims against Cahuzac, which he repeatedly denied, first came to light in a report by French investigative news website Mediapart in December. The website obtained a recording of a conversation in which Cahuzac supposedly told one of his aides that it worried him to have an account in Switzerland, as UBS was not the most discreet bank. 'Spiral of lies' The scandal dominated the headlines of French newspapers Wednesday. Newspaper La Liberation plastered one word, ""Indigne,"" or ""Unworthy,"" across it","NEW: French President Francois Hollande says he is ""stupefied and angry"" by the confession.

Risking their lives, the fisherman decided to try and reel in sharks to the shore using a simple rope and a lump of fish as their bait. The bizarre tug of war game that ensued, filmed at a bay in the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory, has been posted on YouTube. Four men went fishing for sharks on the Cobourg Peninsula, 350 km east of Darwin in the Northern Territory . Bull sharks are aggressive and are thought to be responsible for the majority of near-shore shark attacks but the men did not seem bothered. They laughed and joked as they chucked the lump of fish attached to a rope into the water. ‘I’ve got a nibble... here we go,’ shouts one of the men as the rope starts to thrash around. ‘You still got it,' he says reassuring the man holding the rope. The fisherman attached a lump of fish to a thin rope and flung it in the water just metres from where they stood . As a shark took hold of the bait a man cried 'I've got a nibble' and held on tightly . A wrestle ensued as the shark thrashed around in the water and the men tried to pull it to shore . But the rope came away clean with no sign of the fish or the shark . During their numerous attempts in the full-length video the rope comes away clean with no sign of a shark or the fish. 'You've just got to keep walking backwards while it’s shaking its head,’ another man says, implying he’s a bit if an expert. They continue their mission laughing as one man gets dragged into the water and another runs in to back him up. Meanwhile, their friend tries to sneak up to a shark in the shallow water and grab it with his bare hands. Fortunately on this trip the biggest injury they suffered was just a case of bad rope burn.

The Prime Minister has had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine. In an interview on the remote Hebridean island of Jura, where Mr Cameron and his family were on their third summer holiday, he said his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’. It has stopped him from doing his favourite activities including stalking deer – which involves crawling through the heather rifle in hand – and waterskiing. Mr Cameron, who was once credited with killing two stags with one shot, denied that he had given up deer-stalking to placate animal rights groups, calling it ‘probably one of the most defendable’ field sports. But said he was unable to do it on Jura, where he was staying on a 20,000-acre estate owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Lord Astor. ‘I’ve got a phenomenally bad back so I don’t really think I’ll be able to crawl,’ he said . The interview was apparently designed to show a Prime Minister at ease with himself. But Tory MPs privately expressed concerns that openly discussing his interests in hunting, riding and fishing would do little to combat the charge from some critics that he is out of touch with ordinary voters. ‘Another masterstroke from the man of the people,’ one MP remarked.

The pair were filmed by hidden night-vision cameras as they clung to the underside of the Dover-bound lorry in Calais. French Channel ports are seeing a surge in asylum seekers trying to make it to the UK, with hundreds of Syrian refugees among those living in squalid camps awaiting their chance. Dicing with death: A night vision camera catches two men attempting to sit on the axle of a lorry to get into the UK . BBC cameras captured the moment the two migrants clambered on to a British lorry under cover of darkness. Migrants often wait for a truck to stop at a junction before climbing underneath. Gangs can be seen on the road leading to the port as lorries approach. This truck was stopped for the migrants’ safety once they were picked up on camera, and French police were called. Its driver Clive Mills said: ‘I would never have known they were on there. I didn’t see them get on. I was looking in the mirror, looking down the road to pull out – it’s just frightening. Something somewhere has to change because you can kill people.’ The men were asked if they realised the danger they were exposing themselves to, and one replied: ‘Yes, but I have to go there. This country is not good to live in, we have to go to England.’ French charity workers say four migrants died in one week earlier this month as they attempted to get to Dover. Calais, which became a magnet for UK-bound refugees in the mid-90s following the war in Kosovo, is again attracting hundreds of migrants who want to cross the Channel. Many are Syrians, some of the estimated 2.1million who have fled fighting in the country. Britain is the preferred destination for many because of its global language and generous benefits. Strife in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Eritrea has seen a rise in migrants attempting to enter the UK illegally .

e1de38e8584139c7705ebecb9bcbd8758a338011,"Washington (CNN) -- A National Security Agency program for collecting phone and Internet communications of suspected security targets outside the United States has the potential to infringe on the privacy rights of U.S. citizens, according to a report released Wednesday by an independent government review board. The NSA's Section 702 program is still lawful, ""valuable and effective"" in protecting national security, according to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PDF), which noted that ""no evidence of intentional abuse"" was found in the program. However, ""certain aspects of the program's implementation raise privacy concerns,"" according to the report. The large scope of that collection of Americans' information that is supposed to be off-limits -- and uncertainty about the amount of information being gathered -- ""push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness."" Despite procedures to minimize collection of domestic and Americans' communications at home and abroad, the government doesn't know precisely how much data and content of Americans' communications is being collected, the report says. The Section 702 program is derived from a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was amended in 2008 and gave the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to authorize ""surveillance conducted within the United States but targeting only non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States."" Even though the 702 program isn't aimed at collecting domestic communications or those of Americans abroad, ""incidental"" collection of such data does occur, according to the report.

Barack Obama's 30-minute TV ad, which ran simultaneously on broadcast and cable networks at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, is muscle-flexing that has little precedent, a campaign advertising expert said. Sen. Barack Obama aired a 30-minute campaign ad Wednesday night. ""It's evidence, if you needed any, that the Obama campaign has more money than there is ad time left to buy,"" said Evan Tracey, director of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. ""This is flexing the muscles."" Tracey estimates that it will cost the campaign ""in the $4 to 5 million range -- at a minimum, $3.5 million."" But, he said, spending the money is a ""no-brainer"" for the Democratic presidential hopeful. ""The strategic brilliance of this for Obama is that he is going to consume about 24 hours of the news cycle,"" Tracey said. ""It boxes [John] McCain in, takes the oxygen out of the room."" In the carefully produced infomercial, Obama laid out his plans for the economy and for bringing an end to the war in Iraq.

Scientists have warned of a danger to swimmers from the contaminated water, with the so-called KPC enzyme being notoriously difficult to treat. Those who come into contact with the bug can require hospitalization, or in some cases, become carriers of the micro-organism, researchers claim. Scroll down for video . Sailors of the Finn class compete during the first test event for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at Guanabara Bay in August . The Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil's most respected health research institute, said it had discovered bacteria that produce the enzyme in water samples taken from various spots along the Carioca River, Rio de Janeiro. Among the spots is where the river flows into the city's Guanabara Bay, site of the 2016 sailing and wind surfing events. Bacteria with the KPC enzyme are difficult to treat. However, the institute said no instances of infection resulting from the contaminated water have yet been detected. The study's co-ordinator, Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, said: 'The illnesses caused by these micro-organisms are the same as those caused by common bacteria, but they require stronger antibiotics and, sometimes, can require hospitalization. 'Since the super bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism. 'Carriers can take these resistant bacteria back to their own environments and to other people, resulting in a cycle of dissemination,' said the institute, which is affiliated with Brazil's Health Ministry.

Rosberg pipped his English stablemate to pole position by just 0.079 seconds in qualifying at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve to set up a sizzling start to the race. Facing the media in Montreal after his Monaco fallout with Rosberg, Hamilton said the spat was ""done and dusted"". He explained: ""We spoke after the race and just like friends we have our ups and down, we've known each other a long, long time."" It was Rosberg who did the talking on track Saturday, eking out extra pace on his final timed lap round the tricky, temporary circuit on the Ile Notre Dame. The German, who leads Hamilton by four points in the Formula 1 world championship, set a quickest time of one minute, 14.874 seconds. ""I'm very, very happy it all worked out,"" Rosberg told reporters. ""It's been a fantastic day and the best position for tomorrow."" Hamilton, who was upset after being unable to set his potentially quickest time in Monaco because of an error by Rosberg on his final lap, appeared to lock up as he chased down his teammate's leading time in Montreal. Asked by reporters if it would be another tight race between himself and his teammate he said succinctly: ""I would assume so, yes."" Red Bull's reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel defied expectation to finish third with a brilliant final lap. ""I tried to take more risks and it worked,"" said Vettel, who out-qualified his teammate Daniel Ricciardo for just the second time this season. ""I kept it going until the end so all in all a good result and the maximum we could do. ""I'll try and stay as close I can to those two and maybe get some tow. If we have the chance to attack them then we'll go for it."" The Williams, powered by the dominant Mercedes turbo engine, performed well in Canada to show signs of finally coming good on its pre-season promise.

f7c348e02c1b84e9a41fe961b4b6660975a8ead9,"(CNN) -- Uganda's parliament adjourned Friday without acting on a bill that would have made engaging in homosexual acts a capital offense, leaving the future of the widely condemned bill uncertain. Though parliament's mandate ends May 18, next week has been reserved for the swearing in of new members. Friday's lack of action on the proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill means that the issue will not be discussed this session. The bill has been condemned internationally since October 2009, when it was introduced. In addition to proposing the death penalty for certain gay acts, it proposed requiring anyone aware of violations of the bill to report them to the authorities within a day or face criminal sanction, said Human Rights Watch. The bill would have criminalized ""promotion of homosexuality,"" the organization said in a written statement. That would have jeopardized the work of promoters of human rights, it said. The bill or an amended version of it could be presented in the next parliament, which is expected to open in June, Human Rights Watch said. But by then it would have to return to the beginning of the legislative process, the organization said. ""Today marks the end of a chapter in the fight to protect the rights of the LGBT community in Uganda but the struggle isn't over yet,"" said Graeme Reid, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Program at Human Rights Watch, ""There's a real danger we might see this bill remerge in some form."" Amnesty International released a statement expressing relief over the lack of action on the bill, which proposed life in prison for marriage by same-sex couples. ""We are relieved that the Anti-Homosexuality Bill was not passed into law today,"" said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International's deputy director for Africa. ""This bill would have institutionalized the discrimination, including harassment and arbitrary arrests, that LGBT people in Uganda already face."" In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner on Thurs","The bill would have made engaging in homosexual acts a capital offense. The future of the widely condemned bill is uncertain.

Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students . Laura Whitehurst, the former high school teacher accused of having sex with her students and giving birth to one of their children, pleaded not guilty to the charges against her in court on Tuesday. Whitehurst, who was arrested and charged Monday, was arraigned by video inside the San Bernardino Superior Courthouse. ‘She's a clean-cut American girl sitting in jail, so she's having a hard time, but she will be OK,’ her defense attorney, James Gass, said. The former Citrus Valley High School teacher was wearing a green jail jumpsuit, an indication that she was being held in protective custody. The defendant sat quietly and only spoke to answer the judge's questions. Whitehurst, 28, has been charged with 41 felony counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor, which include 30 counts of unlawful sex with a minor and 11 counts of oral copulation of a person under 18, according to court records. ‘The first 30 counts are basically sex with a minor, or an underage person. And then the other remaining counts are oral copulation with a person under the age of 18. There are three named victims in this case,’ prosecutor Melissa Rodriguez said. Whitehurst, from Redlands, California, was arrested last week after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police. The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school. Since then, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst. If convicted, she faces up to 29 years in prison.

The Fatberg, described as 15 tonnes of festering food mixed with wet wipes and a host of other disgusting ephemera, was found blocking pipes under Kingston in south London.

Scroll down for video through the sewer . Screen grab from CCTV footage of a giant 'fatberg' discovered in a sewer under the streets of Kingston in south London. It was described as the size of a double decker bus . The blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage through manhole covers onto the streets of one of the leafiest London boroughs. Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it. Gordon Hailwood, waste contracts supervisor for Thames Water said: 'We've never seen a single, congealed lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before. 'Given we've got the biggest sewers and this is the biggest fatberg we've encountered, we reckon it has to be the biggest such 'berg' in British history.

'If we hadn't discovered it in time, raw sewage could have started spurting out of manholes across the whole of Kingston.' The blockage was discovered after residents in nearby flats complained they couldn't flush their toilets and repairs could take six weeks to complete. Workmen used a high-pressure jet of water to blast away the massive blockage over 10 nights.

The USS John S. McCain, left, anchored at the port of Incheon 40 km west of Seoul, Korea in March 2004. The array was damaged, but the sub and the ship did not collide, the official said. A sonar array is a device towed behind a ship that listens and locates underwater sounds. The incident occurred near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines. The official, who declined to be named because the incident had not been made public, would not say whether the U.S. ship knew the submarine was that close to it. However, the Navy does not believe this was a deliberate incident of Chinese harassment, as it would have been extremely dangerous had the array gotten caught in the submarine's propellers. The Navy has complained in the past that Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, have deliberately tried to disrupt U.S. naval activities in international waters near China. In one widely publicized incident in March, five Chinese vessels maneuvered close enough to the USNS Impeccable to warrant the use of a fire hose by the unarmed American vessel to avoid a collision. The Navy later released video of that incident.","Chinese submarine hits an underwater sonar array being towed by the destroyer USS John McCain.

Vernon told NBC. 'It's lucky no one else was killed or wounded in that crowded apartment, either on purpose or by accident, thanks in part to the boyfriend.'","The incident occurred after a man 'had drunk five or more beers' and started arguing with his common law wife at their apartment in Panorama City. The man called his friend and said he was going to kill himself, according to NBC Los Angeles. As the friend arrived at the scene, he heard yelling and then gunshots. Police said the man shot the 41-year-old victim at least once and then tried to shoot himself.

dfb3dfae0645addcdb649878e88f6376d2df03ae,"Brunswick, Georgia (CNN) -- The investigation into the shooting of a baby in Brunswick, Georgia -- a crime that's grabbed national headlines -- has taken yet another turn with the arrest of a local politician. The arrest stemmed from a verbal exchange between Brunswick City Commissioner James Henry Brooks and the family of one of the teen suspects in the slaying during the suspects' first court appearance on Monday. According to his attorney, Brooks told the family of De'Marquise Elkins, 17, that they didn't have to talk to police. ""What he was trying to do, at the point and time that he was approached here at the courthouse, was just tell these folks you have a right to remain silent,"" Brooks' attorney Alan Tucker told reporters Friday. Brooks is a distant relative of the Elkins family, his wife, Alicia Brooks, told CNN. She did not know exactly how they are related. The 59-year-old commissioner was charged with influencing a witness and obstructing law enforcement in an investigation, the Glynn County Sheriff's Office said. Brooks was arrested Thursday, posted $5,000 bond and left jail Friday afternoon. Tucker said his client was not trying to interfere with the investigation. ""I don't know why he spoke with the Elkins family other than the fact that they are constituents of his,"" the attorney said. ""The public defender's office put a statement out earlier in the week, and I think that there were many people in the community who maybe thought that these two young men had not committed the crime with which they are charged with, and evidence has come to light and the gun was found."" Under the terms of his bond, Brooks is not allowed to have any contact with the victims, witnesses, potential witnesses or investigators involved in the investigation of the murder of 13-month-old Antonio Santiago, who was killed March 21.

William Thoms is just like every other little boy. His mother says he 'loves to make noise'. But only two years ago, the three-year-old could barely hear a thing after being born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left. Despite the long battle ahead of him, in which he has to attend weekly speech therapy classes and audiologist appointments, his mother Penelope from Caste Hill in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that her son was lucky. 'We look at his hearing impairment as fortunate because he was born with it and we can help him at a young age,' Mrs Thoms said. William is one of an estimated 3.5 million Australians who have some degree of hearing loss, according to Australian Hearing. Mrs Thoms first found out about her son's problem within the first week of Williams birth when the hospital performed a number of Statewide Infant Screening - Hearing (SWISH) tests that brought back poor results. The three-year-old was fitted with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant before his first birthday . He's now starting to sing along to his favourite songs and is communicating with others perfectly for his age . 'It was a bit of a shock,' Mrs Thoms said, due to having no family history of similar problem. 'We kept wondering ""what kind of life is he going to have?""' But before he turned one, William was fitted with a hearing aid on his left ear, and by the time he was nine-months-old he underwent surgery to receive a cochlear implant. 'With the implant and hearing aid, he can hear like a normal child. The second we had it switched on – 10 days after the operation - we could tell there was a great improvement,' Mrs Thoms said. 'He could hear all these different sounds, like planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch,' His mother, Penelope Thoms, said of",William Thoms was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear.

ded442323118f357e558fb44368fbdb1016657f2,"(CNN) -- After moving from New York to Virginia Beach five years ago, Jennifer Herzog started noticing something odd when exiting grocery stores. Her hands and forearms felt hot, looked red and were swollen. After a few errands, she identified the irritant: plastic bags. ""There are some plastic bags that do it, and there are some that don't,"" Herzog said. ""All grocery bags pretty much are bad."" She started noticing other irritants, too: She began to have a similar response to fragrances as she had to plastic bags. Now, when she hugs someone wearing certain perfumes or colognes, her face turns red and swells. Dermatologist Joseph Fowler says skin reactions to fragrances and perfumes are common, but to have a reaction from finished plastic products like plastic bags is extremely rare, though not undocumented. ""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy, usually when they're in the raw material state, and the unfinished products,"" said Fowler, co-author of a medical textbook on dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. ""But because the chemicals in finished products are bound so tightly, it's awfully hard for them to penetrate to the skin and set off the allergy."" Then again, the finished products may not be the real problem. A reaction to plastics like Herzog's may have more to do with residue from the manufacturing process than the plastic itself, says materials science expert Andrew Dent. ""There are additives to make the plastic bags easier to process that manufacturers are putting on the outside surfaces,"" said Dent, vice president of materials research at Material ConneXion. ""That could also be the problem."" Others may react with redness and swelling to plastic bags, but they don't necessarily have an allergy. A condition called dermographic urticaria, in which the skin becomes inflamed from scratching or rubbing, is far more common, Fowler explains. For those with the condition, carrying heavy bags from the grocery store could be enough t","Jennifer Herzog's hands and forearms felt hot, looked red and were swollen.

The shifting blame game of who's responsible for American Airlines' ever-growing problems. At the end of the day, travelers want to get from Point A to Point B safely and on time.

American Airlines and any other company that can't fulfill its core mission on a regular basis, whether it's safe and efficient airline travel or safe peanut butter or cynanide-free Tylenol, may not be long for this world. Clumsy fliers spilling Diet Coke and coffee on plane floors and seats, causing ""gunked-up"" seat-locking mechanisms, hardly seem to constitute a root cause. American Airlines says spilled soda, coffee helped cause sticky moments .

Add your own suggestions for how American Airlines can keep or earn your business in the comments below. Admit what's broken and fix it .

043add67723641923208222f5d3af59ae127efa7,"Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said wants to hit better-off homeowners with the mansion tax in the next financial year . Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible. He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth £1million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes. Labour opponents of the party’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’ Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted. The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to raise £2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and ","Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power.

8992121255e7311bfa8aa92e4940074339fab02f,"(CNN) -- New York City has seen a jarring last-minute twist in the race for mayor, in which the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg, may have given a crucial boost to the person he would probably least like to see succeed him in City Hall. Bill de Blasio, who surged into the lead among the Democrats running for mayor, has been campaigning for months as a progressive bent on governing in a way that alters or reverses many of Bloomberg's cherished policies -- starting with de Blasio's proposal to raise taxes on households earning $500,000 or more per year. De Blasio, who is married to a black woman, has also made a series of campaign ads that include his biracial teenage children. Bloomberg, in a magazine interview, dismissed de Blasio's campaign as ""class warfare and racist."" Asked to explain the inflammatory charge, Bloomberg said de Blasio is ""making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote."" The comment is, on its face, questionable. Click here and look at the videos for yourself. If de Blasio is using his telegenic family to good effect, it's no different from what candidates have been doing for centuries. If the comment was intended to halt de Blasio's momentum, it surely failed -- and appears to have backfired -- with the most relevant audience, the active Democratic base likely to turn out on primary day. In fact, within hours of publication of the mayor's remarks, de Blasio was using the dust-up as part of a fund-raising appeal to supporters. Gov. Andrew Cuomo sided with de Blasio as well. ""The comments that were reported clearly are out of line and have no place in our political discourse,"" Cuomo told reporters.

Alvarenga, who said he was lost at sea for 13 months, returned to a hospital Thursday to be intravenously fed, said Christian Clay-Mendoza, a top Mexican trade official. ""Doctors say he's severely dehydrated and low on vitamins and minerals,"" he said. Alvarenga, an El Salvadoran who had been living in Mexico, washed ashore on the Marshall Islands eight days ago. Earlier this week, his condition improved enough that he was released from a hospital. Doctors said Alvarenga's limbs have started to swell, and they can't seem to keep him hydrated. But he did manage to leave the hospital briefly Thursday to make a few comments to the media. Bewildered by all the cameras, he thanked the government and people of the Marshall Islands for their care and friendship. After his minute-long remark, officials whisked him back to the hospital. Plans for his repatriation to El Salvador on Friday have now been postponed due to his health. Official: His story 'is probable' Alvarenga's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive for 13 months adrift on the Pacific. But from what officials can tell, they have no reason to doubt him.

The agency that oversees development in the San Francisco Bay in California has begun a formal investigation into the construction of a secretive Google Inc barge on an island in the bay. The probe, which began in the past week, will examine what permits are needed to build the barge and whether the owners of the Treasure Island pier where the vessel is moored have the proper permits, said Larry Goldzband, the executive director of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. 'We want to make sure that the permits that are used by the owners of the pier actually allowed for construction to happen,' Mr Goldzband told Reuters on Wednesday, referring to what he described as 'a preliminary and formal enforcement investigation.' Under investigation: City officials began looking into the barge's permits after the Coast Guard requested changes to its design . Google officials informed Mr Goldzband in a recent meeting that they are in the process of making changes to the barge's design which have been requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. Jason Tama, a Coast Guard commander, said he could not comment on any specific cases, but noted that it was standard practice for the Coast Guard to inspect new construction to ensure that safety, security and environmental protection regulations are met. Changes to vessels are a common part of the process, he said. Google did not return requests for comment.

4b6d802324f9ee10fcae5656d597d100a592a963,"Slimy: An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between two trains in Western Australia. This is a file picture of a black Portuguese millipede . An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between  two trains in Western Australia. The crash happened when a train arriving into a station at Clarkson, 25 miles . north of Perth, slammed into a stationary one. It resulted in six passengers being treated for stiff . necks following the crash on Tuesday. But it has since emerged that the crash could have happened after hundreds of Black Portuguese millipedes were found squashed in a slippery mess on the track. 'Millipedes are one of the factors we are going to take into account,' David Hynes, spokesman at the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia, said. 'What happened in previous instances is trains which were travelling at speed have gone over an infestation, crushed them and made the tracks slimy. 'The train loses traction and the train has slipped.' Hynes said. The millipedes are attracted to moist environments and are seen as invasive pests at high population levels. In 2009, thousands of them overran 1.2 miles of track, causing train delays and cancellations near Melbourne in southeast Australia. The black Portuguese millipede is native to Portugal and was accidentally introduced into Australia where it has since become an invasive pest. The millipede has flourished in Australia because of a lack of natural predators. They are most often seen in moist conditions, which creates lots of food. They have also been  known to enter homes. Huge numbers of millipedes were crushed crossing the railway tracks at Tallarook, central Victoria in March 2009, causing train cancellations due to the disturbance of signalling equipment.","Crash happened when a train arriving into a station at Clarkson, 25 miles north of Perth, slammed into a stationary one.

A justice system overhaul was also needed, Mr Andrews said, and Labor would hold a royal commission into family violence in 2015 should it win the November state election. Fairfax, which published the figures, has also reported concerning trends observed by police and support services. They are seeing more cases of children instigating sexualised behaviour at primary schools, men pretending to be boys online so they can trick girls into exchanging explicit photos, and sexual abuse of girls after arranged marriages. Victorian premier Denis Napthine told reporters that figures reflect an increased reporting rate which is welcomed . The number of cases reported annually in Victoria surged 43 per cent in the five years to the 2013/14 financial year . ere was also a 90 per cent increase in cases where a parent was the alleged perpetrator .","The number of cases reported annually in Victoria surged 43 per cent in the five years to the 2013/14 financial year.

The scandal reinforces the risks of age-old intelligence-gathering landmines -- be careful what you say and where you say it. But analysts doubt national security was compromised. ""Petraeus' potential exposure to blackmail, and the dangers associated with the use of nonofficial e-mail accounts that he needed to keep the affair secret, made this a potential national security issue,"" said Stephen Biddle, a professor of political science and international affairs at The George Washington University. Petraeus probe includes top general in Afghanistan . ""The FBI concluded that this was only potential, and that no meaningful security breaches had actually occurred, but the affair created a risk that could have been exploited in the future."" Petraeus resigned last week from the head of the CIA after admitting an affair with a woman later identified as his biographer, Paula Broadwell, 40, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Support: Archbishop Dr Barry Gordon said it made 'no theological sense' to oppose women bishops . Women will be allowed to become bishops in Wales’ Anglican churches following a landmark vote that will surely put pressure on the Church of England to follow suit. Members . of the Church in Wales’ 144-strong governing body voted through the . proposals at a meeting in Lampeter, near Cerdigan in west Wales, earlier today. Supporters and women’s rights groups called the decision long overdue, arguing the exclusion of women from the top roles made the church less relevant in modern society. Wales has now joined Scotland and Northern Ireland in opening their doors to the ordination of women bishops, leaving just the Church of England opposed to the idea. The issue was hotly debated at the Church of Wales’ governing body meeting in the University of St David. The vote needed a two thirds majority from three of the Church in Wales’ 'houses' - Laity, Clergy and Bishops. Laity voted 57 for and 14 against, with Clergy backing the move 37 to 10. Bishops’ vote was unanimously in favour of the plan. Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said it made 'no theological sense' to continue opposing the ordination of women as bishops when the church already ordained them as deacons and priests. It is the second time in five years it had faced the issue. A previous proposal was defeated in 2008 by just three votes. The Bill was proposed by the six diocesan bishops of the Church in Wales. Canon Patrick Thomas of Christ Church, Carmarthen, said: 'I’m happy with Bishop Wyn but would be just as happy with Bishop Wynona.' Nigel King, stewardship officer for the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon, added: 'Do we really care whether the bishop has external or internal plumbing?' Canon Jenny Wigley, from Radyr, Cardiff, said the Bible itself says there should be no differences between people",Wales joins Scotland and Northern Ireland in opening their doors to women bishops.

""I just can't believe what happened. He was honestly the sweetest person I've ever met. He's such a good person and I can't believe he's gone,"" said Parmertor's friend, Gabby Cveljo, CNN affiliate WEWS reported. Funeral services for the slain student were held at the Church of St. Mary in Chardon, Ohio, the network said. Mourners marched silently to the church, carrying the American flag. Others had signs with hearts and stood outside, wrapped in blankets against the cold. Parmertor was killed this week when a lone gunman opened fire on students in Chardon High School's cafeteria. Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire. The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people about 30 miles east of Cleveland. Authorities say T.J. Lane, 17, is charged him with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. The latter is related to the student who was grazed by a bullet. Prosecutor David Joyce filed charges against Lane on Thursday in juvenile court. The defendant's next court appearance will be Tuesday, and a hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court. Lane's friends have said that the teen had a troubled childhood. His parents had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged in an assault on another woman. ""I think there's a lot of kids that go through things like that. That doesn't give them the right to kill other people,"" said Bob Parmertor, Daniel Parmertor's grandfather.

It charges when power is up and the light is on as normal. But when the power goes it automatically switches to battery mode . The product is called iViTi ON and uses technology invented by Litonics Ltd in Knighton, Powys, Wales. ‘iViTi ON automatic switching has the single aim of ensuring that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail,’ the company writes on their website. Today experts warned that Britain must brace itself for power shortages if the country is hit by a severe winter. After a rush to close coal-fired power stations to meet green targets, a deep freeze means mothballed oil and gas power stations could have to be restarted and factories paid to shut down to preserve power. Business leaders warned that for too long, the UK has failed to plan properly to keep the lights on, as the National Grid revealed the average gap between supply and demand will be just 4.1 per cent - the narrowest in eight years. The National Grid report said the country will be eating into its most basic reserve power if there is extreme weather. The appliance operates similarly to existing light bulbs until it detects the power is gone, when it automatically switches to battery operation.

The BBC has called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives, it emerged last night. The corporation’s director general Tony Hall told staff in an internal email he has ordered KPMG to look at deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the severance pay scandal. The National Audit Office is investigating the files of 90 senior managers handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached contractual limits. Questions: The BBC is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers . Its devastating report found the BBC handed its staff £369million over eight years, but only looked in detail at the most recent cases. The KPMG review means even more high-profile deals could come under scrutiny, including a £500,000 payoff to former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham in 2007. He resigned in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about doctored footage of the Queen. Lord Hall has already asked for a ‘detailed briefing’ into his payoff, although the BBC has not yet confirmed whether it will publish what he is told. Another historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six-figure sum handed to Lesley Douglas, a former controller of Radio 2 who resigned over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.

Further violence engulfed the country over the weekend. In the eastern city of Mariupol, pro-Russian forces tricked soldiers into eating food laced with a sleeping potion before taking them hostage on Saturday. Some 2,000 pro-Moscow activists stormed the Odessa police HQ in the normally easygoing Black Sea resort, shouting ‘fascists, fascists’ and ‘Russia won’t abandon its own’ as they demanded the release of almost 130 ‘comrades’ arrested for bloody unrest in which 42 were killed. After forcing their way into the yard and smashing windows, the authorities caved in and released some 30 of the detainees.

The message, which is thought to say in part ‘kiss me’, means scientists may have stumbled upon a nearly millennium-old love letter. It came after PhD student Jonas Norbury unravelled the mysterious Jötunvillur code, which dates back to as early as the 9th century.

The ‘Kiss me’ carving, thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century in Sigtuna, Sweden, was written in cipher runes, the most common code known from medieval Scandinavia. ‘The problem with this code system is that it is impossible to read because the code gives many possible solutions,’ Mr Nordbury told MailOnline.

One such inscription is pictured here. The carvings are thought to say that it was written by 'the most knowledgeable man west of the sea' To read the jötunvillur code, you would replace the original runic character with the last sound of the rune name. For example, the rune for f, pronounced fe, would be turned into an e, while the rune for k, pronounced kaun, became n. While this sounds straightforward jötunvillur code is written in a way that makes the interpretation ambiguous. Mr Norby added that jötunvillur can only be written and not read, which would make it pointless for use in a message. ‘It is, however, possible - with some uncertainty - to interpret the runic inscription on a piece of bone found in Sigtuna as ""","'Kiss me' carving thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century.

e40a4196dd7095f79811ff5ff42123a7a0ed6c77,"(CNN) -- A young baseball phenom has received one of the sport's highest honors -- recognition from the National Baseball Hall of Fame for pitching not one, but two perfect games. And while a perfect game -- defined as one in which the pitcher allows no hits and no walks -- is a rare occurrence for the sport, what makes this 13-year-old pitcher's feat even more impressive is that she did it against the boys. Yes, she. Chelsea Baker, once a student of former major league pitcher Joe Niekro, last week donated the jersey she wore to pitch one of those special games to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The jersey will be part of an exhibit dedicated to the importance of women in the sport, according to the museum. Chelsea, who until recently honed her pitching arm in Plant City, Florida's Little League program, told CNN Sunday that she feels ""really honored and blessed"" to be recognized on a national level at such an early age. In addition to her Hall of Fame achievement, Chelsea was also recently featured on ESPN's ""E:60"" series. Chelsea, who says she has been pitching since she was 7 years old, boasts a fastball in the mid-60s (miles per hour) and a baffling knuckleball that has been known to make her male opponents shed a tear. ""Yeah, when I strike them out with the knuckleball, sometimes they'll throw their helmets and start crying,"" she laughs. ""It's just really funny to watch."" It's a pitch that was perfected with help from Niekro, who was her team's batting pitcher before his death in 2006. ""He would always throw it to us and I could never hit it, and so I'd always beg him to teach it to me and finally one day he just taught it to me,"" she says. The knuckleball has helped propel Chelsea through four seasons without a loss with her Brandon Farms team -- and her batting average isn't bad either, hitting over .600 this season, though she notes ""I like pitching more than batting.""

A woman struck by a syndrome that deformed her face has now been the victim of botched surgery - which means she will never smile again. Carly Swann, 32, was just 14 when her face became paralysed, meaning she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side.

In 2007, the mother-of-two had an operation at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, using muscle taken from her left thigh and put into her cheek. The operation was a success and she regained control and movement in her face, allowing her to smile again - and for two years she lived a ‘happy’ life. But when an infection meant her face would need to be operated on again, the outcome left her devastated. Surgeons at The Royal Hallamshire Hospital interfered with the muscle holding the sling to correct her smile  - which caused it to disappear. Ms Swann later discovered that her operation notes from 2007 were not requested from the hospital who had corrected her smile and restored her confidence. She was awarded a substantial sum in compensation from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after they admitted clinical negligence. Ms Swann, who works as a PA, said: 'It was the worst point in my entire life when I saw what they had done - my face was ruined. 'They had completely destroyed my chances of smiling again.

9a1c543dbe0292dc15e00eb22fc1bad763edc6a6,"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The second son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared via a video link Sunday at his trial at a court in Tripoli, where he and dozens of former senior regime officials face charges for crimes they are accused of committing during the 2011 revolution. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, has been held in the western mountain city of Zintan by the militiamen who captured him in 2011. The group has refused to hand him over to the central government, citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital. The trial was held under tight security with roads leading to Tripoli's al-Hadba prison blocked off by security forces and gunmen positioned on the building's rooftop. The judge read the charges against the defendants, which included the killing of protesters -- a crime punishable by a death sentence -- and other alleged crimes to try and suppress the 2011 uprising. Among the 23 defendants present at the hearing were Abdullah al-Senussi, the elder Gadhafi's brother-in-law and former spy chief, former Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and the regime's head of foreign intelligence, Buzeid Durda. Eight other defendants held in the city of Misrata also appeared via video link at the trial. After more than two years in prison, Senussi, who was extradited from Mauritania, appeared frail and had lost weight. Gadhafi seemed relaxed and frequently smiled during the two-hour proceeding. In response to the judge's question on whether he had a lawyer, Gadhafi responded twice, saying, ""I have God"". He later said he did not have a lawyer, and the court ordered one to be appointed for him. The International Criminal Court in the Hague indicted Gadhafi and Senussi on war crimes, but Libya refused to hand them over, arguing they had to face justice in their own country. Although the international court granted Libya the right to try Senussi last year, his ICC-appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling. Some defendants complained","Saif al-Islam Gadhafi has been held in the western mountain city of Zintan by militiamen.

A shocking study has revealed that nearly one in three children in Britain have contemplated suicide by the age of 16. Stress over exams, fear of failure and concern about body image are just some of the pressures harming teenagers' mental health, the major survey discovered. The worrying findings by MindFull.org - a new website launched today which aims helping youngsters find counselling - has led to growing calls for teens to be given mental health lessons in school.

So it's hardly surprising that it's in need of a painstaking cleaning and maintenance programme - an annual event which  takes two weeks to complete. This huge task begins with a thorough refurbishment of the dance floor, which since the ballroom opened 118 years ago, has been graced by millions of fox-trotting feet and sees 650,000 visitors each year. A team of maintenance engineers strip back, sand and polish the 120ft parquet floor, consisting of 30,602 blocks of mahogany, oak and walnut. The ballroom’s 14 ornate Edwardian chandeliers are then lowered, and every shard of crystal is buffed. Each of the 1,120 lights must be individually inspected, to ensure their perfect working condition for the coming season. General Manager, Kate Shane, explains: 'Of course it's a colossal undertaking, requiring huge skill, but it's maintenance work such as this that keeps the opulence and grandeur of The Blackpool Tower Ballroom alive.

5b25f7ee66d2f68f10241132b2e38c69f64a4064,"(CNN) -- A relatively obscure drug used to treat mouth sores has made obese mice thin -- and the mice didn't have to eat less or exercise more, according to a study at the University of Michigan. Doctors at the university will begin studies in human beings later this year. Hopes are high, even though many drugs that work in mice do not work in humans. ""It is a tour de force and offers a new and potentially exciting opening for developments of new anti-obesity drugs -- something which is badly needed,"" says Dr. George Bray, chief of the Division of Clinical Obesity and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. In the study at the University of Michigan, researchers gave mice a high-fat diet, and they became obese. They then injected the animals with a drug called amlexanox, which has been on the market for more than 15 years to treat canker sores. The mice lost weight, even though they kept eating the same number of calories. When they were taken off the drug, the mice gained all the weight back. If amlexanox works in humans -- and that's a big if -- Bray said it could become like the story of Viagra, which was originally developed to treat one condition, chest pain, but serendipitously was later found to treat a different condition, erectile dysfunction. ""It could well be that what works for one disease will turn out to work for another, even though that wasn't the original intent,"" he said. The researchers screened several drugs and found that amlexanox, used in an ointment to treat canker sores, changed the action of genes that control metabolism. When injected in mice, the drug worked by increasing metabolism, not by suppressing appetite. ""One of the reasons that diets are so ineffective in producing weight loss for some people is that their bodies adjust to the reduced calories by also reducing their metabolism, so that they are 'defending' their body weight,"" says Dr. Alan Saltiel, the lead researcher at the University o","A drug used to treat mouth sores has made obese mice thin.

Emad Karakrah, 49, also allegedly threatened to bomb police when he was pulled over on Wednesday. Police approached the driver after 911 reports of a 'suspicious person' in a silver car shortly after 9am. He refused to stop and patrol cars were forced to chase him through the city as he ran red lights. When he was finally apprehended, Karakrah told police he would detonate a bomb he had in his car, according to a police report seen by NBC. The threat led to the bomb squad, FBI and Homeland Security being called but after extensive searches, no explosives were discovered. He has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for making a false bomb threat and aggravated fleeing and a misdemeanor count of driving on a never-issued license. The 49-year-old appeared in court and was held on $55,000 bond on Thursday. He is due back in court on September 3.

Like many young girls in Zimbabwe, Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease. This so-called virgin myth, perpetuated by Zimbabwe's traditional healers, has led to the rape of hundreds of girls, according to UNICEF. Some of those victims are too young to walk, much less protect themselves. Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country's young girls from sexual abuse.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic (centre) trains ahead of Chelsea's visit to PSG in the Champions Legaue on Tuesday .

Ibrahimovic came up against Cristiano Ronaldo in the play-off to reach the World Cup in Brazil last summer, but it was Sweden that were on the losing side and the PSG forward let everyone know there wasn't much point in watching a tournament that didn't feature himself. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was like ""No way, Zlatan doesn’t do auditions"".'

Mixed-up teenagers have gone online to praise Will Cornick, the murderer of Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, and he is reportedly being sent letters from admiring peers. Some youngsters have even used the term 'good times' - the words uttered by Cornick in the moments after his horrific attack - as a sickening catchphrase. Will Cornick (left) was jailed for at least 20 years for the murder of teacher Ann Maguire (right). He is now reportedly receiving 'fanmail' after youngsters praised him online . Cornick, 16, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of the popular teacher at Corpus Christi College in Leeds in April this year. But a Facebook group set up in his name has seen some teenage girls claim they find the 16-year-old killer attractive. After website users attacked Cornick, one girl wrote: 'Calm down. I love Will!!!' in a comment that was then 'liked' by a friend. In another 'liked' comment, a schoolgirl wrote: 'He's so buff.' When asked what she meant, she replied: 'Good looking.' One girl even repeated the phrase Cornick used after he stabbed his teacher, writing  'good times' on the page, followed by a thumbs up symbol. Again, her comment was 'liked' by others.

Murray is shortly expected to announce a new major sponsor, joining Laura Robson and James Ward on the clothing-go-round as British players’ on-court appearance change considerably in 2015. Robson has also left adidas and gone to their fellow giants Nike, while Murray is expected to replace his expiring five year $15 million deal with an arrangement promoting a company less automatically associated with tennis.

It is believed that a frontrunner in negotiations has been American company Under Armour, who are more known in this country for their deal kitting out Tottenham Hotspur. At present their tennis involvement has been limited, although they currently kit out rising American star Sloane Stephens and the veteran US journeyman Robby Ginepri. It could be that they see Murray as a good fit for their slightly edgier, sport-specific image. Industry experts say that New Balance have also been interested in expanding their tennis presence, although last year they signed Canada’s Milos Raonic. Rumours that Murray might revert to his old clothing partner, Fred Perry, are reckoned to be inaccurate. Regardless, the money is not likely to approach the $3 million per year that adidas have been paying the 27 year-old Scot over a period that took in his Wimbledon, US Open and Olympics triumphs. Murray shows his frustrations on court as he suffers defeat to Roger Federer at The O2 last month .

The Falcons scored six tries - and had the try-scoring bonus point wrapped up by half-time - as they registered their biggest Aviva Premiership win for eight years. Three of those tries came in a seven-minute first-half spell and effectively ended any hopes London Welsh may have had of sparking a fightback. Ally Hogg of Newcastle Falcons scores a try during the Premiership clash with London Welsh . Newcastle's first-half hat-trick came shortly after the visitors squandered an early chance, when big Tongan number eight Opeti Fonua broke from the base of the scrum. His offload to Peter Browne should have led to a score, but the flanker could not hold the pass. It proved a costly miss, with Newcastle stepping up the pace to score those three tries in seven minutes to lead 19-0. Tom Catterick nearly cut through on the 22 to set up a series of forward drives and Kieran Brookes was stopped right on the try line. Sinoti Sinoti of Newcastle Falcons challenged by Paul Rowley during the 38-7 victory for the home side . That led to the opening try by Sinoti Sinoti, with Ally Hogg picking up from the base of the scrum and flicking the ball out to Sinoti, who stepped inside Elliot Kear and outside Paul Rowley to score. Newcastle were quickly back on the attack when Welsh failed to clear a long kick and then conceded a penalty which the Falcons put in the corner and drove prop Rob Vickers over for a try converted by Catterick. The third try followed when Sinoti blasted through and passed inside overhead for Mark Wilson to send in Mike Blair and Catterick again converted for 19-0.

Four-time grand slam champion Sharapova had not played since crashing out in the second round at Wimbledon in June due to a hip injury. Former world No. 1 Sharapova looked on course to make a victorious comeback in Cincinnati when she took the first set 6-2 against her 17th-ranked opponent. But Stephens bounced back, recovering from 2-6 0-2 down to take the match 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 and register her second career victory over a top-three ranked player. ""It definitely started out a little rough for me, but I'm glad I was able to turn it around and start playing some good tennis in the second and third sets,"" 20-year-old Stephens told the WTA's official website. ""At the start of the second set I was just going to start going for my shots a little more and hoped they would just go in. I'm glad I started hitting and finding a rhythm. That kind of helped me out for the rest of the match. ""Obviously when you're playing someone who's No.3 in the world, you know they're No.3 for a reason and they're going to be tough. You've got to go out and play your hardest. But when you think about it, you're like, 'Okay, I'm playing Sharapova.' Like, you've got to get your mind right."" The match was Sharapova's first since hiring U.S. legend Jimmy Connors as her coach and, while quick to credit Stephens, she was disappointed she was unable to continue the form she showed in the match's opening set. ""I didn't continue what I was doing well for the first set and a half, and that hurt me,"" explained the 26-year-old. ""I stopped being patient. I started making a lot more errors, especially off the first ball. Just errors I shouldn't make. ""Obviously I haven't played in a long time, but I've got to be ready from the first match.

Vice President Joe Biden congratulated Tony Blinken on his confirmation. ""Admired in every corner of the world,"" Biden said of Blinken in a tweet that included a picture of the two of them strapped inside an aircraft. Blinken was a member of the Obama-Biden presidential transition team in 2009 and later became Obama's deputy national security adviser.

McCain condemned Blinken for being one of the ""architects"" of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq in 2011, which McCain believes precipitated the growth of ISIS, the terrorist group that now controls parts of Iraq and Syria. McCain pointed to statements Blinken made then that ""Iraq has never been so prosperous, so powerful, and peaceful as it is today,"" as reason enough for preventing his nomination. Blinken ""was wrong, he was dead wrong, he made many, many statements about Iraq, and unfortunately thousands of people are dead now and parts of Iraq are now controlled by the deadly organization called ISIS,"" said McCain. Rubio said he's opposed to the nomination because Blinken's answers to questions about U.S.-Cuban relations were inadequate.

Doctors face an inquiry into the death of tycoon Scot Young after it emerged he left an NHS mental health facility just hours before he fell 60ft from a flat. Mr Young, 52, who was involved in one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases, landed on metal railings outside a £3million apartment earlier this month. It has emerged that he had admitted himself to the NHS Gordon Hospital in central London on December 5. The facility specialises in treating the most severe mental health problems and its website says it only admits patients who are ‘in an acute phase of a serious mental illness’. But Mr Young walked out on December 8 and was dead hours later, after showing up at his ex-girlfriend’s apartment and warning he was going to jump. Health workers were obliged to contact him within 24 hours for a check-up, but he was dead by the time they called. Doctors were accused of failing Mr Young, who had twice previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was taking prescription medication for bipolar disorder. His family is furious that he was allowed to leave the facility when he was apparently acting ‘manic’ and ‘crazy’. But as Mr Young had not been sectioned, hospital staff could not force him to stay. The NHS has begun an investigation to find out why he was discharged. James Creed, one of Mr Young’s closest friends, said: ‘He was in a mental home. He was in the same place two years ago, it’s a horrible place. He called me when he was there, every day. Then he called me on the Monday and said he was coming out. I don’t know why.’ Mr Young, a former fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on railings outside a flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone.

eaea980d64884048d21d035cf2ab3497ac9c7d1d,"A newly discovered and often deadly virus related to one that causes the common cold has struck another victim, this time in France. A man hospitalized in April is infected with the novel coronavirus, France's Health Ministry said Thursday. The NCoV virus was recently found for the first time in humans and scattered cases have occurred across parts of the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia. It has proved deadly in more than half of the confirmed cases so far, according to the World Health Organization. Of 31 people with confirmed infections, at least 18 have died. But infectious disease specialists believe the virus is very difficult to catch. The newly infected man is the first confirmed infection in France, the Health Ministry said. He had recently returned from travel to the United Arab Emirates, which is on the Arabian Peninsula. Identifying the source of the man's ailment took time, the ministry said. France's Pasteur Institute confirmed the case Wednesday. The Health Ministry is seeking anyone who may have had contact with the patient. NCoV, like some common colds, is also caused by a coronavirus. And like a cold, it attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said. But symptoms are severe and can lead to pneumonia and even kidney failure. ""Once it gets you, it's a very serious infection,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. NCoV has also been compared to related coronavirus, the one that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which appears to have been contained in 2004, according to the CDC. Although its discovery in humans is new, NCoV would seem potentially deadlier, when contracted, than SARS. Of the some 8,000 verified cases of SARS, fewer than 800 people -- less than one-tenth of those infected -- died.",A man hospitalized in April is infected with the novel coronavirus.

The method describes a process that allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then learn more about their atomic arrangement. It was pioneered in the early 20th century when scientists discovered that X-rays could be used to 'see' the structure of matter in a non-intrusive way. When X-rays hit a protein crystal they are scattered by individual atoms, and the way they are diffracted depends on the how the atoms in the molecule are arranged.

The militant group has not released any statement on the deaths. Boko Haram has attacked various targets in the nation since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches. It is suspected to be behind a gruesome mosque killing this week. In that attack Sunday, militants brandishing automatic weapons killed 44 worshipers in the country's troubled Borno state. Around the time of the attack, the group released a video boasting that it was growing stronger. Boko Haram translates loosely to ""western education is forbidden/sinful."" It holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a state in northern Nigeria under Islamic law. Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of extrajudicial killings in its fight against the militant group.

4324850ba5e1496c168efb915f29be9c575a4bd9,"(CNN) -- CNN on Thursday continues its series ""The Sixties,"" which explores the decade of historically significant social movements, people and events. The new episode -- ""A Long March to Freedom"" -- focuses on the Freedom Summer of 1964 for a very notable reason. This week marks the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer -- the tumultuous period in our history when three young workers were kidnapped and murdered in Mississippi while attempting to register people to vote. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner shall never be forgotten. The three youths were civil rights workers in Mississippi who had taken their summer to help eligible citizens to register to vote, a right that state and so many others down South had denied for more than one hundred years. As the men drove through Philadelphia, Mississippi, they got a flat tire. The town's deputy sheriff put on his patrol car's red light and pulled them over. He called for two highway patrolmen. Forty-four days later, the FBI found their bodies in an earthen dam. Goodman and Schwerner, white students from the North, were shot through the chest. Chaney, an African-American student from Mississippi, was beaten to death. Though 18 men were indicted on federal conspiracy charges and were likely present at the killings, seven were convicted. The longest sentence served was just six years. Those three men knew the risks they were taking, one reason why they were making haste through Mississippi's countryside and small towns. They had no desire to be martyrs. Yet, they were killed by racists who sought to stop their campaign to secure each Mississippian the right to vote. It was their deaths, along with hundreds of actions by courageous civil rights workers during the Freedom Summer of 1964, that mobilized the Congress to end the filibuster and approve the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and gave much needed momentum to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Immigrant mothers: More than a quarter of births in Britain last year were to mothers born outside the UK . A record number of nearly 200,000 babies were born to immigrant mothers last year, figures revealed yesterday. The children of women who were themselves born abroad made up nearly a quarter of all the babies born in Britain. The report by the Office for National Statistics pointed to the growing impact on the population of the historically high levels of immigration in recent years. It said understanding the impact of childbearing among migrants is ‘essential for planning services such as maternity provision and schools’. The figures showed that 24 per cent of births in 2011 were to women who had not themselves been born in Britain, which is the best indicator statisticians have for who is an immigrant. In London, where a high proportion of migrants choose to live, the share of births to foreign-born mothers was well over half, 57 per cent.

The manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement is required to notify the FDA of any adverse events linked to its product, according to agency spokeswoman Tamara Ward.

bac88375c4b51aa414d918d2fb4aebe5825c42f1,"(CNN) -- Italian teenager Federico Macheda enjoyed a remarkable debut to English football as he curled home an injury-time winner that sent Manchester United back to the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 3-2 home win over Aston Villa. Macheda receives a hug from manager Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring Manchester United's last-gasp winner. It seemed United would have to settle for a point after Cristiano Ronaldo's double had only proved enough to keep United level against a Villa side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor. But 17-year-old substitute Macheda, a former member of the Lazio academy who arrived at Old Trafford in 2007, was to have the last word. Who is Federico Macheda? At exactly the same moment as Yossi Benayoun struck for Liverpool at Fulham on Saturday, Macheda turned onto Ryan Giggs' low pass before unleashing a stunning shot that curled past Brad Friedel and sent Old Trafford into ecstasy. United, missing a host of players including Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, started poorly against an out-of-form Villa side who had gone eight matches without victory. However, a stunning piece of skill from Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 14th- minute lead. James Milner and Friedel got themselves into a muddle, forcing the Villa keeper to handle a back pass. The resulting free-kick saw Ryan Giggs brush the ball to Ronaldo, who sent a fierce shot over the wall and into the roof of Friedel's net in a flash. Villa were not to be denied and they drew level when Gareth Barry wriggled his way into space by the touchline and Carew crept between Gary Neville and John O'Shea to steer a deft header into the bottom corner of the net. The visitors then took a deserved lead on the hour mark when Ronaldo gifted possession to Stiliyan Petrov, who swept upfield unopposed. He found Carew, whose perfect cross was headed home by Agbonlahor. The goal stung United into life and they levelled with 13 minutes ",Federico Macheda scores an injury-time winner to give Manchester United a 3-2 win over Aston Villa.

Trails spanning 150 kilometers wend through forests that are home to a number of endangered species, from the maned sloth to the brown howler monkey. The trail to one of the peaks on the island, Pico do Papagaio, offers a rare, close look at what remains of an Atlantic Forest.

When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. Now, however, law enforcers in two American states are using crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervising them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system uses a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers, and will be extended to Washington D.C. soon. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Prof. Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future.  It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. He told ABC News that currently parole officers are using their own judgment to decide what level of supervision each parolee should have, based on their criminal record. His software, he said, replaces that 'ad-hoc' decision making, and should identify eight future murderers out of 100. He said: 'People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future, but what really matters is what that person did as a young individual. 'If they committed armed robbery at age 14, that's a good predictor. 'If they committed the same crime at age 30, that doesn't predict very much.' Prof. Berk's researchers used the details of more than 60,000 crimes then wrote an algorithm to find the people behind the crimes who were more likely to commit murder when they were out of prison.

There was an upholstery workshop and, in the tack room, saddles embellished with silver. At the centre of an estate of more than 15,000 acres, Belvoir was the Duke’s private fiefdom. His Sunday morning routine included a visit to the dairy to sample the cheese after a service in the castle chapel. This was the world — lavish, aristocratic, rarefied — in which Lady Ursula, the eldest of the Duke’s five children and now 98-year-old great-aunt of the present 11th Duke of Rutland, spent much of her childhood. Lady Ursula’s memories range from Downton-style Christmas parties for estate workers — at which, one year, every servant was given a gift of an orange and a lemon — to being photographed in an antique silver wine cooler large enough to hold two children. In the castle Muniment Room, she discovered a letter from Charles II in which he addressed his downtrodden wife Catherine of Braganza as ‘my dear little whiffy-whoffy’.

2c49d9643f56871b5f8a28c3b669216f5972c74c,"(CNN) -- The Brazilian National Council of Justice, which oversees the nation's judiciary, passed a resolution Tuesday that denies notaries the right to refuse to perform same-sex marriages. In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. Recently, 12 Brazilian states began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert their civil unions into marriages. However, since the Supreme Court does not carry legislative powers, it was up to each notary to officiate at their discretion, and many refused, citing the lack of law. Same sex marriage: Who will legalize next? Joaquim Barbosa, president of the Council of Justice, said in the decision that notaries cannot continue to refuse to ""perform a civil wedding or the conversion of a stable civil union into a marriage between persons of the same sex."" Barbosa, who also presides over the Supreme Court, says the resolution merely follows the transformation of society. ""Our society goes through many changes, and the National Council of Justice cannot be indifferent to them,"" he said. Civil unions between same-sex couples have been recognized in Brazil since 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to ""stable unions"" of heterosexual couples would apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. People in same-sex unions are also allowed to extend health benefits to their partners, following the same rules applied to heterosexual couples. Brazilian lawmakers have debated same-sex marriage, but in most cases, the bills introduced have not progressed through Congress. Brazilian neighbors Uruguay and Argentina are the only other two countries in Latin America that have laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.","In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. 12 Brazilian states recently began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert civil unions into marriages.

Miss Walker used to self-harm in her sleep and woke with injuries ranging from small grazes, to gashes which left pools of blood in her bedding. Stephanie Walker (pictured with her boyfriend Matt Daniels) developed a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut herself in her sleep - it was so bad that she would wake up to find her sheets soaked in blood . She struggled with an unusual and terrifying form of sleepwalking but has recently found relief thanks to a combination of medication and therapy. She was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she couldn't get up during the night. When this treatment failed, she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy. This treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries. Miss Walker said: 'I had one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor.

'It scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because I had no conscious outlet for the stress I was feeling.

a47fb77ef646cde9a2f1cbb310d09a7dd80148ae,"(CNN) -- Anyone who has struggled to be healthy is intimately familiar with the counting game. They've counted calories, carbs, Weight Watchers points, their heart rate, steps and miles. Now a new smart eating utensil called the HapiFork will help them count bites during meals, and maybe shame them into eating slower and potentially losing weight. Technology has made it easier to track the minutiae of everyday life, with smartphones, pedometers and small sensors that can fit in wearable devices such as wrist bands. The self-tracking hobby has blossomed into the quantified-self movement, which reaches far beyond the health conscious. People are tracking their sleep patterns, heart rate, mood, air quality and work habits, often in a bid to analyze enough data to correct problems with their health or lifestyle. ""Whatever we can measure, we can improve,"" said Fabrice Boutain, CEO and founder of HapiLabs. In the case of the HapiFork, what can be improved is how fast people eat. It takes 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full and that it's time to stop eating, putting speedy eaters at risk for being overeaters. The HapiFork team says there are many potential health benefits to eating slower, including decreasing acid reflux, obesity and diabetes. The $99 fork first gained attention during the Consumer Electronics Show in January and will be on the market by the end of the year. How it works . The fork can be used to passively track eating habits and automatically sync that information, including duration of meals and frequency of forkfuls, with a smartphone. The HapiFork mobile app will also include a coaching program and tools to connect with friends and family. The device can also be set up for behavior modification, vibrating any time the diner is eating too quickly as a gentle reminder to slow down. By default it is set to allow a bite every 10 seconds, though the exact time is customizable.

It's an attempt by the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol to rally support for a vote in November that would legalize the drug for recreational use. Colorado legalized marijuana for medical use in 2000. Last Friday, the group aired an advertisement on a local Denver channel during daytime programming encouraging people to ""start your conversation about marijuana."" The 30-second spot features a young woman typing a message to her mother on her laptop, explaining that after spending her college years drinking heavily, she now prefers marijuana because ""it's less harmful ... I don't get hung-over and honestly I feel safer around marijuana users."" The marketing campaign aims to ""break down the stereotype about who the typical marijuana user is,"" explained the campaign's co-director, Mason Tvert. ""Most of them are professional, hard-working people,"" he said. The TV ad, which aired only on Friday, cost about $2,000, according to Tvert. It may run again, depending on fund-raising efforts, he said. Last month, the campaign spent about $4,500 on a billboard near Denver's (Sports Authority Field at) Mile High stadium -- purposely adjacent to the Mile High Liquors store -- to deliver a similar message, Tvert said. The billboard also features a woman, this one in her 50s, standing with her arms crossed next to the message: ""For many reasons, I prefer ... marijuana over alcohol. Does that make me a bad person?"" Watch the TV ad .

Three years ago, it was he who was erupting, the then Sunderland captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in Newcastle during a night out with team-mates.

I was told he was training on his own away from everybody else. I thought I’d meet Lee and he’d have a gun and he’d shoot me in the head.’ Twelve months on and Poyet readily admits that Cattermole is the first name on his team sheet. The 26-year-old has just been voted North East Football Writers’ Player of 2014 and the manager is backing his on-field lieutenant for an England call-up — ‘In Uruguay, he would be the hero, the captain,’ he says. The respect is mutual. Cattermole says he has come a long way in 12 months under Poyet. ‘In the last year I have learned a hell of a lot,’ says the anchorman. Poyet took over as manager of Sunderland in October 2013 and continues to work with Cattermole . ‘Gus coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award, which I’m chuffed about.

Jan Brewer will likely veto politically-charged legislation that supporters say promotes religious freedom and opponents contend discriminates against gays and lesbians. Brewer did not signal her intention either way in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. ""I can assure you, as always, I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona,"" she said. But some Arizona Republicans who know her well say they are confident those comments mean Brewer will almost surely reject the bill that is generating nationwide controversy. The Republican-led measure would allow Arizona business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers as long as they assert their religious beliefs. Brewer is scheduled to return to Arizona on Tuesday, and a  source tells CNN those familiar with her thinking say she will likely spend at least one full business day in the state before acting. ""I'm going to go home, and when I receive the bill, I'm going to read it and I'm going to be briefed on it. We have been following it. And I will make my decision in the near future,"" Brewer told CNN. She has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill. If she does nothing, it automatically becomes law. Arizona GOP sources say Brewer considers herself a pro-business governor -- someone who above all else wants to protect and promote Arizona's economic interests. They say she knows full well there will be economic consequences for the state if it has a law on the books perceived to effectively codify discrimination.

ab75c2dff95a835781b3fa114a3b5646c8b69147,"(CNN) -- It was supposed to have been over in a few days. World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless. But that's not the way things happened. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark, analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions, including success based solely on surgical airstrikes, for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months. ""It's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this,"" said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security, a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world. The basic problem, McGregor said, stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition. Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia, Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi. Western powers believed that with a little help, Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule. But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges. This wasn't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support. ""This revolt never really had the strength to succeed,"" McGregor said. ""There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up. But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first. If you're just going to run out on the streets, the results will be predictable."" Four months on, the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves, McGregor said. They are out of fuel, oil production has shut down, and they have few available resources. They will soon face even shortages of food and water, McGregor said. President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces. There is debate, too, in Europe over the expensive air campaign.

On the same day that Winston announced he's going pro, the woman who accused him of raping her filed a lawsuit against FSU - alleging that the university failed to investigate her claims and did nothing to stop her being bullied and threatened until she was forced to drop out. 'FSU became a sexually hostile environment where her rapist roamed free and could turn up at any moment, where she became the target of death threats and vilification campaigns,' the lawsuit says, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Winston, a 21-year-old junior, says the 2012 sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and has denied that he raped her. The prosecuting attorney's office said there was not enough evidence to charge him. And last month a Florida State University ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing. Jameis Winston is expected to be picked early in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft - despite the specter of rape allegations hanging over him . Winston has said that the sex with his rape accuser was consensual. He was never charged with a crime and last month he was cleared of wrongdoing by an investigative panel at FSU . The rape allegations - along with off-the-field antics, including a shoplifting citation - are likely to keep Winston from being the no. 1 prospect in the NFL draft. But, with numerous teams desperate for a talented quarterback, he's still expected to be drafted early in the first round. 'After weighing this decision with my family and friends, I have decided to declare for the 2015 NFL draft and forgo my remaining eligibility at Florida State. I reached this very difficult decision after careful consideration and long thought, realizing how difficult it would be to say goodbye to my family at Florida State,' Winston said in a statement on Wednesday.

Confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late-night gig - only to realise 4AM was the name of the band, not the starting time. Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’. The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm. 'Very confused': John Adams (left) and Joe Becket were baffled after council officials mistook their band name, 4AM, for a late-night stage time . Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council. She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers. 'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: ""What on earth is this all about?"".

Now, with yet another huge stride having just been taken on her impressively rapid and upward career trajectory, the 21-year-old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets. The unwelcome blip of failing to make the 800 metres final at the World Indoor Championships in March seemed to have been well and truly forgotten earlier this week as Muir surveyed Hampden and the multi-coloured arena which will provide the stage for two landmark athletics meetings that could potentially send this modest shooting star into a different stratosphere. Ready to rumble: Laura Muir has toughened up for the Commonwealth Games . One, of course, is the Commonwealth Games, where she plans to contest both the 800m and 1500m. The other, which comes first, is the Diamond League meeting which will pitch up at the home of Scottish football on July 11 and 12. Muir – who clearly can’t wait to try out the revolutionary track - will run the 800m on that occasion and, in what will be a fascinating sub plot, so too will her compatriot Lynsey Sharp. The fact that both are finding form at just the right time means a Scottish head-to-head for honours is considerably more than just a remote a possibility. On Sunday, In the Dutch city of Hengelo, Muir took part in her first race of the outdoor season and promptly ran a 1500m personal best time of 4:02.91. At the same meeting Sharp, who has not had her injury troubles to seek, was also breaking new ground for herself – a time of 2:00:09 providing an 800m personal best and putting the European champion second in the Commonwealth rankings. Moving up a rung on the athletic ladder has to be hard-earned though and, even if it might not necessarily be part of her nature away from competition, Muir insists she is more than happy to fight her corner now when it comes to the dark arts of racing. ‘I remember during what wa",The 21-year-old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets.

'Day of reckoning': Gordon Brown has warned that Italy and France may need bailouts as the Euro debt crisis spreads . France and Italy may need massive bailouts, as the euro approaches its 'day of reckoning', Gordon Brown warned last night. The former Prime Minister, who played a key role in co-ordinating global action in response to the Credit Crunch, accused European leaders of failing to rise to the challenge of the crisis - and warned that Europe could be facing a 'lost decade'. In a hard-hitting article for the Reuters news agency, Mr Brown said the European economy was in a 'downward spiral that shows no sign of ending'. He said Greece was likely to suffer a 'chaotic' exit from the euro regardless of the result of Sunday's elections, with a string of other countries likely to suffer serious financial contagion as a result. He warned that Europe's banks may need a further £400 billion in emergency funding. Writing on the eve of the G20 Summit in Mexico, Mr Brown urged world leaders to bring forward radical proposals to stave off the threat of collapse. 'The standard, but often empty, language of summit communiqués will simply not do when the euro area is finally approaching its own day of reckoning,' he said. 'Whichever way the Greeks vote in Sunday's election, a chaotic exit from the euro is becoming more likely - its tax revenues are collapsing, not rising as promised. 'Unable to regain access to markets, Portugal and Ireland will soon have to ask for their second IMF programmes (bailouts).

Net lending by banks to cash-strapped businesses collapsed by nearly £10billion last year, figures revealed yesterday. The Bank of England statistics make a mockery of Project Merlin, the Government's attempt to encourage banks to boost credit for companies. The figures come as a survey by financial specialist Bibby Financial Services reveals the owners of small firms are resorting to drawing on personal savings to keep their businesses going. A separate survey of more than 11,000 members of the Federation of Small Businesses showed a third had used their own savings to fund their businesses. The Bank of England figures offer a devastating insight into how five of Britain's biggest banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Santander – behaved towards firms last year. The figures show that between January and December, net lending – the amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount that was repaid – slumped by £9.6billion. This means banks received £9.6billion more in loan repayments than they paid out. Overall, the gross lending target to small firms was £76billion, but the five banks managed to hand out only £74.9billion. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Small firms are still finding it too difficult to secure the finance they need.' Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the promises of Project Merlin 'were not worth the paper they were written on'. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat . peer who resigned over Project Merlin, said the lack of lending was 'a . knife in the back for growth and jobs'. Figures: The Bank of England's 2012 'Trends in Lending' data is not directly comparable with the Project Merlin figures, but shows that net lending to SMEs has actually been falling since 2008 .
