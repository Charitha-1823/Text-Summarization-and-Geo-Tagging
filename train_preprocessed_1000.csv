Temperatures soared to 17C in Brighton and Dorset, with people starting their long weekend in deck chairs by the sea. Figures from Asda suggest the unexpected sunshine has also inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages and equipment expected to triple those in April. Sun's out: Brighton beach was packed with Britons enjoying the unexpected sunshine to start the long weekend as temperatures hit 17C across the south coast . Although frost is set to hit the south tonight - with temperatures dropping to 1C - Britons stocking up for a barbecue will be in luck tomorrow, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny weather across southern England, southern Wales and the south Midlands.

However, the north east enjoyed a bright spell at midday today with sun shining in Harrogate and York ahead of the rainy weekend.

Don't get caught, or the game ends. This is quidditch, as played by muggles. In JK Rowling's novels, the snitch is a sort-of magical, winged squash ball, pursued by ""seeker"" Harry Potter in a variety of high-stakes, airborne quidditch contests. Nobody on the UCLA campus has a magical, winged squash ball. A man with a tennis ball dangling from his shorts will have to do. ""The snitch is the surrealist aspect of the game,"" concedes Sebastian Milla, former UCLA quidditch player and star of a fly-on-the-wall documentary about his sport. Mudbloods -- a title taken from the novels' derogatory term for wizards with non-magical parents -- explores the result when you take a fictional sport and make it real. In 2005, eight years after the publication of the first Potter book, Vermont's Middlebury College gave birth to ""muggle quidditch,"" which translates Rowling's imaginary sport into our world. Nobody can fly, but a broom between the legs remains mandatory. Three circular goals are used at each end of the field, as per the books. Ten points are scored for getting the ""quaffle"" (a volleyball) through those hoops, and 30 for catching the snitch. Where magical ""bludgers"" are unavailable, they are replaced by dodgeballs thrown at rival players. Finally, and unusually, both magical and muggle quidditch are mixed-gender, full-contact sports. Becoming real . The intrigue for many viewers of Mudbloods will be seeing how this sport works, and discovering who wants to play a sport so closely associated with the world of fantasy fiction. ""It's hard to be taken seriously when people think you're a bunch of geeks,"" MIlla is heard to say as the documentary begins.

When Newsnight's Emily Maitlis asked me during a debate on the programme this week whether I was a feminist, I hoped my blow-dried hair and figure-hugging dress would give her some clue as to the answer. Feeling a little mischievous, I was tempted to ask her whether I looked like one of those grumpy women in bad clothes who spend their days in a state of agitation about whether it's right to let girls play with dolls. But since I was a guest on the BBC's flagship news programme, I decided to park the sarcasm and simply say that I am not: that today's feminism is utterly irrelevant to me. I explained to Emily and my fellow panellists, Professor Mary Beard and Natascha McElhone, that feminism has betrayed its roots and deteriorated into spurious artificial engineering. Rather than campaigning to help women, feminists today are more likely to be picking fights on Twitter, or dressing up petty grievances as proof of rampant 'sexism'. And, needless to say, these devotees of 'equality' believe you can't be a feminist unless you're Left-wing. Spoiling for a fight is the default position of today's chippy feminists. They've turned nit-picking into an art form - and I told Emily as much. No sooner had I said this than I'd elicited the ire of what I call the 'hash-tag sisters' - those liberal commentators on Twitter who rushed to attack me for my unfashionable conviction that feminism has lost its meaning. I was accused of espousing views which are 'poisonous to society', and called 'sad', 'ignorant' and 'stupid'. Someone bitterly declared I must have enjoyed a 'charmed life' - a lazy generalisation by a socialist grudge-bearer who assumes my convictions have been created from a position of privilege.

The rap superstar, featured in the song ""Karate Chop"" by Future, says: ""Beat that p---- up like Emmett Till."" Till, a 14-year-old black youth, was killed in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. He was beaten to the extent that his face was unrecognizable when his body was discovered. He was identified by a monogrammed ring belonging to his father. Mountain Dew, a brand of PepsiCo, said Friday its relationship with the rapper would end. A Mountain Dew spokesman told CNN, ""We do not plan any additional work with Lil Wayne moving forward. His offensive reference to a revered civil rights icon does not reflect the values of our brand."" The spokesman declined to comment on the company's previous relationship with the artist. Sarah Cunningham, publicist for Lil Wayne's record label, Young Money, issued the following statement to CNN: ""I can confirm that due to creative differences, we mutually decided to part ways. It was amicable."" Till, a Chicago teenager who was visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955, was arrested at gunpoint and severely beaten. One of his eyes was gouged before he was killed by a single gunshot to the head. The teen's body was tied to a large fan before being dumped into a river. Members of the Till family could not be reached for comment Friday by CNN, but the Rev. Al Sharpton said he has set up a meeting next week between PepsiCo officials and members of the family. In a statement to CNN, Sharpton said that the situation was a ""teaching moment for Lil Wayne, corporate America and the family of Emmett Till ... more than a condemnation of any one artist, it is an affirmation of Emmett Till and a call for more sensitivity about what we say and do in our culture.""","Lil Wayne's lyrics include what PepsiCo calls an ""offensive reference"" to Emmett Till .

Focusing on sporting success is a waste of time because 'very, very few children' are going to make it, an academic has said. Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University, says there is little proof that the Olympic Games create any kind of meaningful sporting legacy.

'We shouldn’t be trying to channel all of our energy into this pursuit of excellence in sports when very, very few children are going to succeed at any kind of level at all,' he said. 'My answer to parents who tell me their child might become a leading footballer or athlete is that they are putting them at risk of serious injury or closer to the world of performance-enhancing drugs.

Children's play is under threat from adults who ‘over-supervise’ and ‘over-schedule’, a report says. It says youngsters cannot develop normally and are ‘play deprived’ because of our risk-averse, regimented lifestyles. This means many lack vital skills such as resourcefulness, independence or self-regulation. The research, discussed on EU ‘play day’ at the European Parliament yesterday, is the work of Dr David Whitebread, a senior lecturer in psychology of education at Cambridge University. He consulted researchers from across Europe and found children’s leisure time is cut down by too much school work, safety fears, and lack of understanding of the impact of free play. His report, The Importance of Play, warns ‘play provision is under threat in Europe’ and adult intervention is often ‘counter-productive’. It says the UK in particular is ‘quite risk-averse’, with children ‘heavily supervised’ and forced to play indoors or in a garden or specially designed soft play area. This compares with the more rural Scandinavian countries where children play independently in natural surroundings. Just a generation ago, British children did the same, it adds. Children have ‘increasingly limited opportunities for the free play and association with their peers which were so commonly available . . . to their parents and grandparents,’ the report says. Life in big cities adds to the problem, making children ‘much more heavily scheduled’.

In all, 11 people died Tuesday in events relating to the referendum, Ahmed El Ansary, head of the emergency unit at the ministry of health, told CNN. Two died of natural causes, while nine deaths ""are suspected to be criminal,"" he said. Clashes were reported in several provinces. At least four were killed in Sohag and one in Beni Seouif in clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and security. Violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for ""yes"" votes inside or near polling stations and preventing Christian voters from reaching polling stations in parts of Upper Egypt, which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of Islamist groups. But Hisham Mukhtar, the executive director of the Higher Education Commission, told state-run Masriya TV, ""so far, there haven't been any reports of fraudulent activities and the referendum is being conducted in a very calm and fair atmosphere."" On Monday, Mukhtar told Al-Ahram that the nearly 53 million eligible voters were divided among more than 30,000 committees and would be supervised by more than 13,000 judges. The violence began even before polls opened at 9 a.m., when a bomb exploded near a Cairo courthouse. No one was hurt, security officials said.

The widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of triple  killer Harry Roberts last night told how she was ‘terrified’ that he was to be released next week. Joan Cartwright, 71, said nobody had told her about the release of the career criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – and she learned about it only because the story was published in the newspapers. She said the decision had left her in fear for her life, and she attacked the Parole Board for their decision, saying Roberts is a ‘sick man’ incapable of remorse. ‘I’m absolutely terrified at the thought of Harry Roberts being released,’ said Mrs Cartwright, who runs a sanctuary for around 100 animals. ‘I’m frightened he will send someone to kill me.’ She added: ‘He shouldn’t be afforded any human rights for what he’s done. What about the human rights of the police officers and people he has killed?’ Five years ago Roberts’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised Mrs Cartwright and her family after she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the East Midlands.

Mrs Cartwright told how she and her late husband, Peter, who died of a heart attack eight years ago aged 68, had been forced to give evidence by the police and prison authorities.

While gestures of goodwill spread along the Western Front, the festivities stopped half-a-mile short of where Private Percy Huggins and Sergeant Tom Gregory were on duty in  Rue De Bois, France. The historic ceasefire, which saw men from both sides exchange seasonal greetings and play games of football during the First World War, was shattered by the sound of a sniper's rifle. Private Percy Huggins, left, and Sergeant Tom Gregory, right, were both killed on Christmas Day by German snipers - the same day the famous 'Christmas truce' was declared along the Western Front . Pte Huggins, 23, from the Hertfordshire regiment's D Company, was on sentry duty at a forward listening post just 20 yards from the enemy when he was killed with a single bullet to the head. The shooting enraged his platoon Sergeant Gregory, who demanded he take his place and immediately set about scanning the frost-covered ground before taking the sniper out with a shot. Then as the experienced soldier continued scouring enemy lines he spotted another sniper - but the German marksmen had seen Sgt Gregory, 36, first and in a split-section action shot him dead. The two British men were among the 149 Commonwealth servicemen who lost their lives on December 25, 1914, although many of those died of previously-inflicted wounds. Their story has remained untold, overshadowed by tales of the peaceful Christmas morning shared from both sides of the trenches which has now been retold in a Christmas advert by Sainsburys this year.

The bill covers the cost of vaccinations, accommodation and transport for the monkey, known as Mally, which is now being cared for at a zoo in northern Germany. Customs officials posted a public notice of the bill after failing to get a response from Bieber at the address he gave to customs officials, said Martin Brandlhuber, a customs spokesman at Munich's airport. In light of that, German authorities have followed the applicable laws and made the claim publicly known, he said. Bieber must pay up the next time he comes to Germany or risk being denied entry, Brandlhuber said. If he is unable to pay cash, then customs officials could confiscate other property to meet the claim, Brandlhuber said. Alternatively, Bieber could be denied entry and be required to provide a valid address. The young monkey was taken to a Munich animal shelter after it was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on a European tour. Mally was transferred to the Serengeti Park in Hodenhagen, near Hanover, in June after spending several weeks in quarantine. Bieber had until May 7 to present the paperwork to reclaim his pet but failed to do so, zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel said last month. As a result, Mally is now the property of the German government, and the Serengeti Park is acting as the caretaker. The park was picked because it is the only zoo in Germany that has a family of capuchins for Mally to join. Bieber's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated.

I was so pleased that  Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of Prince Edward  and the Countess of Wessex, appears to have had what  was a fairly dramatic squint corrected. With conditions like this, some people have a tendency to make unfair assumptions about someone’s character based purely on appearance. The family have chosen not  to reveal the details of ten-year-old Lady Louise’s treatment, and whether she had surgery  is not known. Before and after: Lady Louise Windsor in June 2013, left, and right, attenidng the Christmas Meeting at Ascot Racecourse in December after her correction . Although there are many options for treating a squint,  an operation shouldn’t be shied away from – it’s not simply a cosmetic treatment, but one that saves sight. Can’t some people with  a squint see just fine? People can learn to live with varying degrees of vision  and sight loss. But this condition, if untreated, usually leads to deterioration in the capabilities  of the affected eye, which is why treatment at a young age is recommended. A squint – the medical term is strabismus – is when the eyes do not align in their movements. One eye will look straight ahead, while the other turns inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards. As the eyes are focusing on different things, the brain ignores the signals from one eye to avoid ‘seeing double’. It’s this eye that becomes  weak, and eventually vision in it starts to worsen. The problem is often  something a child is born with, evident from birth, and it is due  to weaknesses in the muscles that surround the eye. A child is more at risk of a squint if they are born prematurely, like Lady Louise, or have a family history  of them. Saving grace: The squint, also known as a lazy eye, prevented Lady Louise, pictured before her operation with her mother Sophie Countess of Wessex, from seeing straight . Is surgery the only sure way of correcting it? No, it’s usually offered only once other options have proved ineffective","Lady Louise Windsor, aged ten, has had an eye problem corrected .

Schaefer was serving a 20-year sentence at the national penitentiary in Santiago for sexually abusing children at the notorious commune known as Colonia Dignidad (The Dignity Colony). The commune in southern Chile, also called Villa Baviera, was created as a place to safeguard Germanic traditions. Under Schaefer's rule, contact with outsiders was largely forbidden. Some of Schaefer's crimes date to the 1970s and 1980s, during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who had visited the commune. Former members of the colony have admitted that human rights violations and sexual abuse of children occurred there, saying in a 2006 letter published in a leading Chilean newspaper that they were led by Schaefer's influence. Schaefer had been in prison since 2006 when he was extradited to Chile from Argentina, where he had been living in hiding. Schaefer died Saturday morning of cardiopulmonary arrest, the penitentiary said.

She got it in eight hours -- and nearly $8 million more after that. ""It was the opposite of 'Field of Dreams,' "" said Uhrman, a gaming-industry veteran and former vice president at IGN. ""It was, if you come, we will build this."" And so was born Ouya, a $99 console that's shaped like and is just a hair bigger than a Rubik's Cube. It runs on Google's Android operating system and requires developers to offer a version of their games for free. Kickstarter backers will be getting their Ouyas later this month and they'll go on sale to everyone else in June. Speaking here at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, Uhrman said she got the idea for Ouya (pronounced OOO-yuh) in response to a video-game industry that to her had grown stale. No new consoles were announced at last year's E3 gaming conference by the big three console makers (Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony). In recent years, almost all the most hyped and popular games have been sequels. And the rise of mobile gaming has been limited, turning video gaming into a solitary exercise rather than the social one she remembered growing up. ""The TV is the best screen for playing games,"" Uhrman said in an interview-style keynote with editor Joshua Topolsky of tech blog The Verge. ""I remember growing up, playing with my sister ... I feel like we've lost that. I want to bring back the world of TV gaming."" For gamers, the strength of a console often boils down to the games they can play on it. To that end, Uhrman said 7,000 developers have signed up for Ouya accounts, from big publishers who create multi-million-selling titles like ""Halo"" down to the smaller independents.

Children exposed to high levels of pollution in the womb are at greater risk of suffering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a new study has found. Scientists at Columbia University studied 233 non-smoking pregnant women living in New York. They found children exposed to high levels of air pollution during pregnancy were five times more likely to have ADHD by the time they were nine years old. The nine-year study looked at levels of common pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Researchers measured the levels of PAH in maternal and umbilical cord blood shortly after delivery. And they repeated tests when each of the children were three and five, measuring levels of PAH in their urine. Thirty-three children who had high levels of exposure to PAHs, as measured at birth. Of those, 13 were diagnosed with ADHD hyperactive-impulsive subtype, seven the inattentive subtype, and 13 had both. Professor Frederica Perera, first author of the study, said: 'Those children born to moms who were exposed to high levels of PAH during pregnancy had five times the odds of having an increased number of symptoms.' PAHs are created when products like coal, oil, gas and rubbish are burned but not completely. They don't burn easily, and as a result remain in the environment for long periods of time. Most are used to conduct research though some are used to make dyes, plastics and pesticides. One of the most common ways they enter the body is through breathing in contaminated air. To establish children's exposure to PAHs in the womb, the scientists measured levels of fragments of the mothers' DNA bonded to PAH molecules, also known as DNA adducts, in umbilical cord blood. Previous studies carried out by Professor Perera and her team identified links between higher levels of prenatal PAH exposure and developmental delays in chil","Scientists at Columbia University found children exposed to high levels of pollution were five times more likely to have ADHD by the age of nine .

Twenty years ago, a friend and I were visiting the Taft Museum of Art in Cincinnati and saw an exhibit of African-American quilts. I'll never forget one particular piece by the artist Faith Ringgold -- a family sitting at a Thanksgiving table, with their thoughts sewn into the fabric. I just knew right away: I wanted to tell stories with cotton. It's exciting to start on a quilt. I tape paper to my wall and sketch patterns and notes. Going to the fabric store for the right colors or prints feels as important as the actual sewing. And then I clear out a huge empty space in my family room, and I get busy. I don't know how to draw, so it amazes me that this magical, creative part of me comes out. Here's an example: A few years ago, when I was yearning for a date on a Friday night, I asked myself, ""How can I capture this feeling in fabric?"" So I made a quilt that reads ""SBF praying for a SBM to share my quilt."" The image is of a black woman, and if you look really closely, the background pattern is filled with couples. I love layering the story like that. I probably couldn't make a living quilting, and I'm glad of that. My 9-to-5 job as a product manager means I don't have to make quilts to sell.

The Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein. Now, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work. ""It is difficult because of the destruction,"" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. ""This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities."" Workers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades. ""We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,"" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. ""We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take."" Iraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility. Despite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it ","Complex at the center of Saddam Hussein's nuclear efforts slowly being dismantled .

In 2004, a monstrous black wave of rubble surged towards Rinaldi as he ran for his life. In October, the trauma of that day was relived as he took part in a drill to test the area's new tsunami early warning system. Five years ago, Rinaldi had no shelter to run to as giant waves crashed onto Indonesia's west coast, but things have changed since the tsunami left some 245,000 dead or missing in 14 countries across the Indian Ocean region. Early warning sirens drone, and there are shelters that can hold hundreds of people. Twenty nations took part in the October tsunami drill. The Indian Ocean region now has new deep-water buoys -- or tsunami sensors, sirens, tide gauges and a web of communications systems to help forewarn a future catastrophe. But experts said the new instruments and drills are not enough. Educating communities about how to react to signs of a threat like a tsunami -- with or without an official warning -- is what they see as a key challenge.

Did you lose a loved one? Share your thoughts on the 5th anniversary on CNN iReport . Situated in a high-risk zone, Indonesia now has developed the capability to warn of the potential for a tsunami from an undersea earthquake within five minutes of its occurrence. By next year, the country aims to take its warning system to the next level by calculating the height and the arrival of a tsunami, said the director of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, Fauzi, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. In 2007, India put into place an early warning system that officials say is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and connected with international networks.

Christians in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday protest the slayings of seven Christians in weekend violence. Rana Sana Ullah, Punjab's provincial law minister, told CNN that the paramilitary Rangers force was helping police and maintaining law and order. Seven people were killed and 20 injured Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, authorities said. Police said the Muslims were protesting an alleged desecration of pages in the Quran, the Muslim sacred text, at a Christian wedding. At a news conference in Islamabad carried on local TV, Shehbaz Bhatti, federal minister for minorities, said an investigation determined there was no desecration of the Quran in village 95 Gill near Gojra City, and the allegations were baseless. He also said the government will rebuild all the burned houses. Bhatti told CNN that four women, two men and a child, all Christians, were either shot to death or killed when their houses were burned. About 50 houses were burned down, and more than 100 were looted by the protesters, Bhatti said. The incident occurred in Gojra City, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore.

Mike Tindall agonised over his decision to retire, even after 17 years of top-flight rugby, according to Iain Balshaw. Tindall became the last of England's 2003 World Cup winners to hang up his boots on Tuesday, choosing not to chase a new start after being left surplus to requirements at Gloucester. The 35-year-old admitted he felt he could have played for two more years, but did not seek a new club after being released by Gloucester. Calling it a day: Mike Tindall has retired, bringing to an end a 17-year rugby career . Former Gloucester, Bath and England team-mate Balshaw said Tindall will not regret retiring, but still had to wrestle with the decision. 'It's a huge call for him to make, more so when you're not forced to retire through injury,' said Balshaw. 'He had a fantastic season last year, I know that he really wanted to carry on this year and stay at Gloucester, that wasn't to be. 'He will miss it, but he's made the decision to quit and he's got to look forward to what lies ahead. 'Only he knows, after 17 years, if would have really wanted to carry on he would have done so.

He’s done it before — only once, mind you — beating Manchester United in the first FA Cup final at the revamped Wembley back in 2007. So the shock loss to Bradford City really hurt. It wasn’t just the humiliation of losing, at home, to a team two levels below Chelsea. It was the thought of depriving the club and the supporters of a day out at the home of English football.

That may seem far-fetched given the path travelled by the Special One. Champions League finals, a UEFA Cup final, the San Siro, the Bernabeu — Mourinho knows his way around elite European football. But there’s something intoxicating about Wembley, and he knows it. He’s Portuguese, but with the heart and mindset of an English football fan. So when Chelsea take to the Stamford Bridge pitch on Tuesday night for their finely balanced Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, he knows what’s at stake. ‘This is our only chance to go to Wembley so it is important,’ said Mourinho. ‘To go there should mean a lot to everyone. We need to forget the FA Cup and think of the next one in a different competition — we are one victory from the final.’ Shaking off the embarrassment of losing to Bradford is likely to be an issue if the Blues are to get there. Mourinho will demand a reaction. And, to be fair, his side tend to deliver. Chelsea won both matches following their two other defeats this season, against Newcastle and Tottenham. On Tuesday, however, it will have a different dynamic.

8caef764f070085e8ea399b4504c7de6cdad1d5e,"(CNN) -- Two Minnesota state lawmakers said Friday that they have reached a deal to compensate victims of the Interstate 35 bridge collapse that killed 13 people in Minneapolis last year. Thirteen people were killed and dozens were injured in last year's collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. State Sen. Ron Latz and state Rep. Ryan Winkler told CNN Radio that the deal totals $38 million and will be presented to the Legislature for approval. Latz said the deal would expedite compensation to victims who chose to take their portion of the settlement and waive their right to sue the state. The plan addresses a key sticking point in negotiations: preserving a state liability cap on awards to individual victims, Latz said. Winkler said victims will be able to collect up to $400,000 and people whose damages exceed $400,000 will be able to pull from a supplemental pool of more than $12 million. ""There are a 182 potential claimants out there,"" Winkler said. ""There were 13 dead, and there were 12 catastrophic injury cases."" Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he would welcome the deal for survivors and relatives if the Legislature approves it. ""I look forward to signing this legislation into law,"" Pawlenty said in a statement. ""It provides needed relief and support for victims and family members directly impacted by the I-35W bridge tragedy. I'm pleased that Senator Latz, Representative Winkler, my office and others were able to work together to craft this legislation."" The bridge collapsed during afternoon rush hour August 1, sending dozens of cars tumbling into the Mississippi River. Photos of the scene showed cars, trucks and a school bus lingering on the bridge's uneven remnants. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating why the bridge collapsed. In January, NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said investigators studying the bridge found that 16 gusset plates, which strengthen the junctions of steel beams, were fractured.

In his filing last May for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which he sought to have his assets liquidated and his debts discharged, Jason S. Rodriguez listed his assets at $4,675 and his liabilities at $89,873.31. His 2002 Nissan XTerra with 110,000 miles represented $4,000 of those assets. His personal property filing described the vehicle as having body damage on the right side, an air conditioner that did not work and a transmission that was slipping. He said his monthly income as a ""sandwich artist"" at a Subway Restaurant in Orlando, where he had worked for nine months, was $890.67, and he listed his monthly expenses at $815. A man who answered the phone at the restaurant referred a caller to company headquarters, where spokesman Kevin Kane confirmed that Rodriguez had worked for the company, but left six weeks ago. Kane said the company has a job title of ""sandwich artist."" Before leaving Subway, Rodriguez's income had already taken a hit, dropping from $27,686 in 2007 to $13,936 in 2008. Rodriguez estimated the value of his household goods -- a TV, microwave, bed, computer, dresser, two night stands, etc. -- at $500 and said his girlfriend owned the remaining household goods.

Bullock is at the top of the publication's highest-earning actresses list for 2014. Forbes, which speaks to agents, producers, lawyers and others in the know to come up with its list, believes that Bullock's hefty payday is due to her Oscar-nominated turn in Alfonso Cuaron's blockbuster ""Gravity."" After its release in the fall of 2013, the sci-fi thriller went on to earn $716 million worldwide. Coming in second place is Jennifer Lawrence, star of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""X-Men"" franchises, who also squeezes in dramas such as ""American Hustle"" in her downtime. Forbes estimates the young Oscar winner earned $34 million between June 2013 and June 2014. In third place is Jennifer Aniston, whose $31 million comes from comedies such as ""We're the Millers,"" ""Friends"" reruns and endorsement deals.

As the potential GOP presidential field awaits his decision on a White House bid, Bush has said he'll make up his mind by the end of the year. His push for Common Core has made him a target for conservative ire. Some Republicans, backed up by polling that indicates the program struggles in popularity, complain that the program interferes with local government control, by infusing more Washington bureaucracy in education. The standards were developed by the bipartisan National Governors Association, state governments and nonprofit groups. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core.

But Thiem, the youngest man in the top 100 of the world rankings, currently occupying 57th spot, saw enough in Nadal's game to predict he will be holding the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy aloft on Sunday week. ""I think here in Roland Garros there are only a few man who can beat him, but yes he is the biggest favorite,"" Thiem told CNN. Nadal suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in Monte Carlo, Barcelona and in last week's Rome final to Novak Djokovic, but Thiem believes he is an altogether different proposition at the clay court grand slam. ""He's in his element at his favorite venue and he's really pumped up,"" he said. ""His top spin is really tough to counter and he didn't make a lot of mistakes."" After his victory, Nadal was also full of praise for his young opponent and applauded him off the court. ""He has completely everything to become a champion,"" he predicted. ""He as able to hit the ball very strong from the backhand and the forehand.""

City's 4-0 win over Aston Villa means they need just one point from their final game of the season to win the Barclays Premier League.

They are likely to miss out on European qualification altogether thanks to a disastrous campaign under David Moyes, who was recently fired just 10 months after being appointed successor to Sir Alex Ferguson.

But the club's all-time top goal scorer, who is now a director at Old Trafford, has told City the balance of power will swing back in United's favour next year.

ce82584a7eb91ba754d0c2b0ba156d85607cbf6e,"(CNN) -- Blaming the moon is a popular pastime. Police say crime rates go up during a full moon, nurses claim birth rates go up, authors set werewolves and vampires loose upon the land, and people think craziness abounds -- witness the word ""lunatic,"" which derives from ""luna,"" the Latin word for moon. None of this moon-linked strangeness has ever stood up to serious scrutiny. But now a team of astronomers at Texas State University-San Marcos has suggested that the moon can be blamed for the sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage 100 years ago. How the moon caused icebergs to litter the Titanic's path, on April 14, 1912, is really a story about the Earth's tides. What we now know about where icebergs originate and how they travel could have informed the Titanic's crew and perhaps avoided tragedy. But at the time, this science was in its infancy. The Titanic's captain did not expect icebergs to be a problem -- rarely did ice travel so far south into the Atlantic. Yet contemporaneous warnings from other ships suggested there were an unusual number of icebergs. Passengers reported seeing ice floes, lookouts spotted ice and sounded warnings, and other ships in the area reported fields of ice near the disaster site. Here's where astronomy comes in: Three months earlier, on January 4, 1912, the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years occurred within one day of the Earth's closest approach to the sun (which occurs once per year), all within minutes of a full moon, meaning the sun was perfectly aligned on the other side of the Earth (this happens every couple of weeks). The odds of all three events occurring at once are, well, astronomical. This lineup had to have caused unusually high tides in the North Atlantic. Tides are caused mostly by the differential pull of the moon's gravity on the Earth. The pull is strongest on the near side and weakest on the far side, since the strength of gravity, as Isaac Newton told us four centuries ago, falls as the s","A study by astronomers says the moon's position may have had a role in Titanic sinking .

I knew there was something wrong with my shoulders because it felt as if my arms were attached by rusty nails. Looking at the scans, the surgeon made it clear: I needed surgery in both shoulders. I couldn't accept this reality. These surgeries aren't just a giant setback for my career as an acrobat, they could pose a threat to my sobriety. I am a recovering heroin addict who cannot take opiate painkillers. I have witnessed many recovering addicts relapse after surgery. I've traveled this path myself after a few terrible root canals from another medical experience, and came crawling back to heroin. I've learned not to take any risks. How can I wager my recovery on the scales of justice? On one side sits surgery with the possibility of relapse. On the other sits an injured body in pain. How could I bargain the one element that has given me a beautiful and free life? Addict goes under the knife . My first fear revolves around the actual pain itself. Narcotic painkillers are the number one prescribed medication after surgery because painkillers kill pain. During my active addiction, I lived many years with the ability to eradicate pain at my own whim by simply pushing the end of a syringe. Now, in recovery, I must bow down and surrender to it. Is there a difference between eradicating pain and pain management? Do all opiate addicts have to suffer through physical painful situations? I've played this scenario out many times. I am prescribed narcotic painkillers after surgery, while holding on to the absolute perspective that no matter what, after six years of sobriety, I WILL NOT RETURN TO THE MADNESS OF ADDICTION. Depending on strength and dosage, I'm instructed to take one to two pills every four to six hours. It takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of the first pill.

But Dennis Sorensen from Denmark is living proof that working appendages can reinstate senses as complicated as 'feeling'. The incredible technology, revealed by MailOnline last year, is the first bionic hand that allows the user to feel the sensation of touch though the device. The 36-year-old was fitted with the robotic limb, known as Lifehand 2, in Rome on January 26 2013 but the medical breakthrough has only now been shared. Dennis Sorensen of Denmark (left) has become the first amputee to be fitted with a bionic hand (right) that allows him to feel what he is touching in a groundbreaking medical procedure . 'The sensory feedback was incredible,' said Mr Sorensen, who spent a month trying out the hand. 'I could feel things that I hadn't been able to feel in over nine years. 'When I held an object, I could feel if it was soft or hard, round or square.' Mr Sorensen had his hand blown off in an horrific New Year's Eve firework accident at a neighbour's house in Aalborg, Denmark, where he still lives. Since then he has been wearing a . conventional prosthesis that detects muscle movement in the stump of his . arm, allowing him to open and close his hand and grasp objects.

He now has to cope with the psychological challenge of having re-experienced a sense of touch only to lose it again. 'I was more than happy to volunteer for the clinical trial, not only for myself, but to help other amputees as well,' he said. The 36-year-old underwent the procedure to fit the arm at Gemelli Hospital in Rome, the first such medical procedure of its kind and a breakthrough in bionic limbs .

The first festival, organized by the French in 1939 as a response to the Venice Film Festival -- then a vehicle for Nazi propaganda movies -- had to be canceled after it launched on the day WWII broke out. The festival returned in 1946 and has since been a fertile ground for taboo-breaking films, wannabes disrobing for a shot at fame, public spats between directors and critics and publicity stunts gone wrong. The latest rumpus surrounds ""Grace of Monaco,"" a biopic of Grace Kelly, the Oscar-winning American actress who subsequently became the princess of Monaco. The film has been criticized by the Monaco royal family who said it contains ""major historical untruths and a series of purely fictional scenes.""

Cash-strapped families should not waste their money on organic food because they think it is healthier, the government has warned. Shoppers should instead spend their money on whatever they can afford, even if it means eating tinned or frozen vegetables which are in no way ‘nutritionally inferior’. The government now faces calls to end £20million of subsidies to organic farming, which owes ‘more to myth than evidence’. Critics want the government to end its £20million funding for the organic industry, arguing it does nothing to improve the health of the nation . A recent study in the British Journal of Nutrition found organic crops have up to 60 per cent more antioxidants than non-organic crops. But critics claim there is still no evidence that organic is a healthier option. Amid growing concern that too few people are eating enough fruit and vegetables, the government is at pains to stress that families feeling the pinch should not waste their money on organic. Government frontbencher Baroness Jolly said: ‘It can be difficult balancing a family budget, but in providing a varied, balanced diet nobody need feel they have given their family a nutritionally inferior diet by choosing lower-priced, conventional products.’ Just 30 per cent of people meet the recommendation to eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Among the lowest income groups, just 24 per cent of adults manage their Five-A-Day. Baroness Jolly added: ‘All fruit and vegetables count toward this, whether fresh or frozen, dried or canned, organic or not. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that there is a nutritional premium in some forms above others. ‘Frozen vegetables, for example, are as valuable as fresh in meeting our 'five a day'.’ The government encourages mothers who receive Healthy Start vouchers for fruit and vegetables ‘to get the best value for their vouchers, but we would not expect them to prioritise organic products’.

Just a few days ago, when Paul Ryan was selected by Mitt Romney to be his running mate, there was a burst of media euphoria. The nomination was a game changer. Ryan was an ideas guy. He would elevate what to date had been a lackluster campaign. He had killer abs. But within 48 hours, the so-called ""narrative"" had changed. The narrative is not actual facts. It is how those facts look after they've been run through the political spin cycle. Thanks to modern technology, the whole process of spinning narratives that once took weeks, now happens in the blinking of an eye. Twitter, in its manic frenzy, hopped up on bite-size bits of emotion-filled social interaction, condenses months into hours, news cycles into moments, but without any of the perspective that time or thought brings. Within a few ticks of the clock of Ryan bounding down the gangplank of the USS Wisconsin, he went from ""It boy"" to calamity. Comments about his hair and his missing necktie were so rapidly and extensively commented upon that they had become clichÃ©s before they could be written about in the next morning's paper. Saturday, he was a bold stroke. By Tuesday, Ryan was a potential liability. Old people were sure to hate him.

What had promised to be the beginning of a long overdue debate about ""big ideas"" was now seen, often by the same commentators who were upbeat days earlier, as a trigger for more hopelessly divisive bickering.

It means Miranda has to leave her maternal grandmother, Rita Manning, and move states to Georgia, where sex offender Mr Coleman lives.

Mr Coleman became a sex offender after impregnating Miranda’s mother, Trista Crews Coleman, with another baby. Ms Coleman died one month after Miranda’s birth in a car crash, reported First Coast News. Ms Coleman was aged only 14 when she was first made pregnant, and he was 38. But he filed for divorce and claimed at one point she was pregnant with another man’s baby. However he is still Miranda’s legal father because he was married to her mother when she was born, reported WJXX-TV and ABC News.

Meles had not been seen in public in months, sparking intense international speculation about his health. The government revealed neither the cause nor the location of his death Monday at the age of 57. Meles came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator Haile Mengistu Mariam in 1991 and cemented power in the ensuing decades. Seen by admirers as a force for stability in a region with Islamist insurgencies in Somalia and Yemen and a history of famine, he was also criticized for cracking down on political opposition and the press. ""He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly,"" said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa. But he never overcame his ""mindset as a rebel leader,"" and his democratic credentials were ""poor,"" Johnson said. ""The West turned a blind eye to many aspects of his game that were not up to scratch,"" he added. That's partly because of his action against Islamist movements in the region, including an invasion of Somalia in 1998, Johnson said. ""He supported everything that the United States wanted to do against terror,"" he explained, such as give American drones based in the region permission to use Ethiopian airspace on their way to targets in Somalia. And ""he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care, education, reducing the poverty rate,"" Johnson said. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Meles' ""unyielding commitment to Ethiopia's poor"" in a statement Tuesday, citing his ""personal admiration for (Meles') desire to lift millions of Ethiopians out of poverty through his drive for food security.""

Two dogs from the pack that killed two people await euthanasia Tuesday at a shelter in northeast Georgia. Sheriff's deputies, code enforcement officers and other officials spent most of Monday and Tuesday rounding up 11 adult dogs and five puppies, Oglethorpe County Sheriff's Capt. Shalon Huff said. One more was trapped Wednesday morning, leaving one still to be captured, she said. ""We're just lucky this hasn't happened before,"" said Susan Fornash, director of the Madison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter in Danielsville, where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized Tuesday under orders from a local judge. ""We've had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that. And to me, that was just the forerunner of something like this."" Investigators say they believe that University of Georgia librarian Sherry Schweder, 65, went for her usual morning walk Saturday down Howard Thaxton Road, the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple's property. The dogs were familiar in the area, investigators say, having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane. Authorities theorize that halfway down the lane, about a quarter-mile from her home, Sherry Schweder was confronted by the dogs, which knocked her down and killed her. Her husband, retired UGA language professor Lothar Schweder, became concerned when she didn't return and went out in their Honda CRX to look for her. When he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs, they attacked and killed him too, investigators believe.

The 2012 compensation package for Cook, who took over as chief executive in August 2011, also seemed a pittance compared with his 2010 pay, which was 14 times higher, when the executive served as chief operating officer. Jobs, the iconic CEO and co-founder, died in October 2011 of pancreatic cancer. The maker of the iPhone and iPad noted that Cook will not receive any stock awards for 2012 after he was given about $376.2million in stock awards the year before. The stock awards vest over many years. The 2012 package includes a salary of $1.4million and a non-equity bonus of $2.8million, according to the filing. Apple tends to grant shares to executives every other year. Cook's closest cohorts got big grants in 2012, including top hardware engineer Robert Mansfield, who got shares worth $83million.

ae4ceb3dbc77d35538a0d5c3ea5bbfdb91c6bc41,"(CNN) -- There's been plenty of talk about the gender pay gap in recent days after speculation that recently fired New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson was let go after speaking up about possible pay disparity between her and the previous executive editor, Bill Keller. In response to that talk, the New York Times publisher, in a lengthy statement over the weekend, said Abramson's total ""pay package,"" which included stock and other compensation in addition to salary, was ""comparable"" to Keller's and was, in fact, more than 10% higher during Abramson's last year, and that her removal was due to her management of the newsroom, nothing else. Until we hear Abramson's side of the story, it remains unclear what role, if any, an alleged pay gap played in her fate. What is clear is how outraged women were hearing that the Times' first woman executive editor could be making less than the last male executive editor. It was another reminder, to many women, that the income gap is alive and well. But if one city gets its way, that disparity between what men and women earn will become a thing of the past. Boston has pledged to become the first city in the country to eliminate the gender pay gap. It's certainly a lofty goal: How on Earth will Beantown make it happen?

Not surprising since Aldean's ""My Kinda Party"" tour has sold out in venues across the country, often in under a couple of hours. Last week, the singer's latest single, ""Fly Over States,"" hit the top of the charts, marking his ninth No. 1 overall and his fifth consecutive No. 1 from the ""My Kinda Party"" album. Aldean's sound is a little bit country and a little bit rock 'n' roll. Introspective songs such as ""Amarillo Sky"" and ""Don't You Wanna Stay"" have earned him big sales numbers, but concert fans clamor for his more upbeat numbers such as ""She's Country."" He's also not afraid to step outside his comfort zone -- ""Dirt Road Anthem"" was a collaboration with Ludacris that had Aldean rapping about jumping barbed wire and lighting bonfires. Still, it surprised more than few people in the audience Friday when Ludacris appeared onstage with Aldean during the encore to perform the hit song. While tour buddy Luke Bryan has an infectious eagerness on stage, Aldean rarely breaks his brooding stare. That doesn't change backstage as his tour manager brings him in. He's friendly, but no overly so. I get the impression that manners are as ingrained in this Georgia homeboy as deep as his music. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: .

You're going to have a good time, and we encourage that -- probably a lot more than other people do. (laughs) But that's what you want.

Stoke could affect patients' moral compass, altering they way they think about mistakes and people's intentions, a new study has found. Scientists in Buenos Aires found those victims who suffered a stroke affecting the frontal region of the brain were more likely to forgive, as long as no actual harm was done. The study concluded the effect on moral judgement was similar to those patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It found the stroke patients placed more emphasis on the outcome of a situation, focusing less on what a person's intentions were. Agustin Ibanez, of the Institute of Congitive Neurology in the Argentinian capital, and his team, said: 'For both disorders, patients judged scenarios where the protagonists believed that they would cause harm but did not as being more permissible than the control group.

'I was punished for challenging them and they tried to smear me. Lessons need to be learned by the police, and quickly.’ Sussex Police had investigated a string of incidents which allegedly took place in 2012-2013. But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges of perverting the course of  justice and harassment. A claim of common assault was not pursued as the alleged incident took place more than two years ago and there is a six-month limit on the offence.

While Sir Mervyn said the bigger picture was one of gradual recovery in growth, the impact of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee could  prolong the double-dip recession. Many workers are set to use the Monday and Tuesday bank holidays as the start of a whole week off, costing them just three days of annual leave. The remarks are a blow to David Cameron, who said in his New Year message that the Jubilee and the Olympics meant 2012 ‘must be the year we go for it’. A sign of parties to come: Confetti falls and flags fly from Harrods in London yesterday as the store celebrates the forthcoming Jubilee . In the same period last year, the economy fell short of expectations and grew by just 0.2 per cent. The Royal wedding hit output by 0.4 per cent but over the whole period the economy was able to recover. Sir Mervyn said growth 'zig zag' throughout 2012 with sporting events such as the Olympics providing a much-needed boost. A massive influx of overseas visitors will see them spending millions of pounds","Output fell by 0.4 per cent after extra Bank Holiday for the Royal Wedding last year.. but economy still grew .

The world No. 7 revealed that the virus had affected him when losing to Frenchman Benoit Paire in last week's Rome Masters. The 24-year-old's withdrawal follows that of world No. 2 Andy Murray, who pulled out of the year's second grand slam with a back injury. ""This is a tough blow, because these are the events you dream of winning,"" said del Potro, who won the U.S. Open in 2009, on the ATP website. ""Now I must get over this disappointment and recover completely in order to prepare at 100% for the tests to come."" The virus affecting Del Potro had prompted the tall right-hander to miss recent tournaments in Portugal and Madrid, and he returned in Italy with the hope of being able to compete at the French Open. Despite his exit in the third round, he will always remember his time in the Italian capital after meeting with the Pope, a fellow Argentine, last week -- an experience del Potro said he would ""never forget"". Del Potro reached the semifinals of Roland Garros in 2009 and the quarterfinals last year -- only to be beaten by Roger Federer on both occasions. He was joined in withdrawing from next week's event by former world number seven Mardy Fish, who is now ranked 41st in the world, and fellow American Brian Baker -- whose absences had been expected.

Brimble, a mother of eight who lured the boy to her rose-covered home in country Victoria for sex, is expected to escape prison when she is sentenced on Thursday for what her victim’s parents describe as ‘evil’ acts upon their son. Just two years after graduating from university to take her ‘dream come true’ job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys.

She pleaded not guilty to all six charges. Brimble so influenced the boy, his parents said that he believed she could control his thoughts and he ended up so traumatised he had to be medicated. During a trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting ‘bizarre’conduct and a baffling’ psycho sexual profile’.

One of the peculiar laws of quantum physics is that a particle can be in two different physical states at the same time - like how the Cheshire Cat could separate itself from its smile. If, for example, a beam of neutrons is divided into two beams using a silicon crystal, it can be shown that the individual neutrons can travel simultaneously along both paths in what is known as a ‘quantum superposition’. And now scientists have measured this bizarre property, which means that they might be able to control the behaviour of neutrons in future . Scientists have observed for the first time a weird quantum phenomenon known as the 'Cheshire Cat' effect (illustration shown). The 'cat' in question was a subatomic neutron particle, and the ghostly 'grin' the particle’s magnetic moment, which describes the strength of its coupling to an external magnetic field . The groundbreaking research was performed by an team at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France. The quantum Cheshire Cat follows in the paw steps of Schrodinger’s cat, the most famous feline to make an impact on the world of physics. In Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger’s celebrated 1935 thought experiment, a cat that is both alive and dead was used to illustrate the apparent paradox of quantum superposition. The imaginary experiment involved a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity, caused by the decay of a single atomic particle, the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. Theoretically the particle can be in a superposition of a decayed and non-decayed state at the same time, logically leading to the cat being both dead and alive. But this state of affairs only lasts until the box is opened. Once an observer peers inside the box, a cat that is either alive or dead is revealed.

It's the ""beginning of the mission's primary objective: the exploration of Pluto and its many moons in 2015,"" said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado, in a NASA news release. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft was launched on January 19, 2006. It's down to the final 162 million miles of its journey and will arrive July 14, 2015. New Horizons has had 18 hibernation periods totaling 1,873 days to save wear and tear on its components. This was its last nap. Mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, say a preprogrammed command ordered the spacecraft to switch from hibernation to ""active"" at 9:53 p.m. (EST) December 6. ""This is a big deal. It means the start of our pre-encounter operations,"" said Glen Fountain, New Horizons project manager at APL. The mission managers will spend several weeks checking out the spacecraft and testing computer commands to guide New Horizons through the rest of its flight. The probe is 27 inches (0.7 meters) tall, 83 inches (2.1 meters) long and 108 inches (2.7 meters) wide. It weighed 1,054 pounds (478 kilograms) at launch.

Eto'o joined Everton on a free transfer after being deemed surplus to requirements by former side Chelsea . The Everton striker will be hoping to get on the scoresheet against Crystal Palace on Sunday . ‘He’s won a fair few things in his career, it’s surreal when you list them all. People questioned him after not playing as much at Chelsea last season but he still scored a fair amount of goals for the amount of game time he had. ‘In the short time he has been here, he has shown his class. He knows how to play the lone striker role or how to play with a striker. 'He is a presence who knows when to wait for runners as you saw with his assist for Kevin Mirallas on Thursday night. He is a fantastic signing for us and a massive asset.’ The Cameroon striker won two Champions League crowns and three La Liga titles with Barca before landing the Treble for Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan in 2010. He will also prove his worth with Everton who are now in a run of seven matches in three weeks.

Blairite MP Liz Kendall is being widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May, it emerged yesterday. The Leicester West MP is a member of a ‘breakfast club’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. All four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in Portcullis House before meetings of Mr Miliband’s shadow cabinet. Many MPs from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the Blair/Brown wars of the past if Labour doesn’t win in May. A clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers. Other challengers are likely to include Andy Burnham, the party’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at Labour conference last year. Mr Burnham’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the NHS from further privatisation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a Labour loss. Her husband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily. Yesterday the Independent on Sunday reported Miss Kendall, a Leicester MP, had emerged as the favourite among Blairites impressed by her TV performances. It was also suggested that the quartet of Blairites will unite to try and block Mr Burnham, and suggested Mr Umunna would also be a likely candidate. Other Labour MPs are said to prefer the prospect of a joint ticket involving Mr Hunt and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves.

While the artefact is less glamorous, it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the Romans to have survived. The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay. Archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. It is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since Roman times . Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at the fort, has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the Roman army, as well as everyday items like letters, shoes and babies' booties. He made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it, providing oxygen-free conditions. There are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the Roman Empire but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many Roman soldiers.

The rise in ‘community justice’ means crimes as serious as murder and sexual abuse are going unreported – a situation reminiscent of Belfast in the height of the Troubles. Tom Winsor said police officers were simply never called to some neighbourhoods, where law-abiding people rather than criminals administer their own form of justice . Honour killings, genital mutilation, and domestic violence are some of the offences thought to be unreported . He said: ‘There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve the police at all. I am reluctant to name the communities in question, but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves. ‘There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own. ‘It’s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or don’t want to go into those areas,’ he said. ‘But if the police don’t get calls for help then, of course, they won’t know what’s going on.’ Honour killings, domestic violence, sexual abuse of children and female genital mutilations are some of the offences that are believed to be unreported in some cities. Last December, three members of a self-styled ‘Muslim Patrol’ vigilante group were jailed for harassing, intimidating and assaulting people in East London while claiming they were enforcing sharia law. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor warns police officers are never called to some areas . In an interview with The Times, Mr Winsor said: ‘It could be anything. [Honour killings] are the most extreme case. That is murder. There is no honour in it.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said the rising number of unreported crimes was a damning indictment of our police.

Reginald Garcia will use cash from the sale of 130 unpublished Jackson photos to fund testing of the motor, which he claims generates more electricity than it uses. Garcia is in the process of getting the photos appraised and prepared for sale. The photos show a 19-year-old Jackson and his brothers during a video shoot at a Hollywood studio in March 1978, before he began changing his appearance with surgery. The Afro hair style and 1970s clothing show ""a rare glance"" of Jackson in an ""awkward teenage stage,"" an image that he personally tried to bury in later years, according to a collector who sold photographs to the singer. ""If it was an image he didn't like, he was more likely to buy them than if they were images he did like,"" said Keya Morgan. ""Were he alive now, I would definitely go to him and I'm sure he would want to buy them."" With Jackson gone, Morgan's Keya Gallery is buying the image copyrights and helping Reginald Garcia sell the original slides, prints and contact sheets that have been forgotten on his shelf for decades.

A toddler who suffered a fatal wound to the head was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, despite no-one being charged over her death. An inquest into the death of Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who was 21 months old when she died, heard she was subjected to a non-accidental 'blunt force trauma'. Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder after her death because all three had cared for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been hit. Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death . Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services. But a coroner has now ruled she was 'unlawfully killed' The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no-one could be prosecuted over her death because it could not be established whether it was her mother, stepfather or maternal grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured. At the end of an inquest today, Assistant Deputy Coroner Oliver Longstaff said the non-accidental nature of the injury had been established not merely on the 'balance of probabilities', but also 'beyond reasonable doubt', as is necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts. He said: 'In my view, and to the criminal standard of proof, I am satisfied that whatever the state of mind of the perpetrator of the act that caused Summer's ultimately fatal injury, it would have been obvious to that perpetrator that Summer was being subjected to forces far in excess of anything she might have been expected to withstand, and which were overwhelmingly likely to cause her very significant injury. 'I accordingly will record a conclusion that Summer was unlawfully killed.","Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe died of a blunt force injury to the head in 2012 .

After the unprovoked assault, Earle called an ambulance himself and told police they could find him at a nearby community centre. Police arrived at the scene to find Miss Thrower lying in a pool of blood from a stab wound to her lower back and another which punctured her abdomen. She was rushed to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where medics discovered one of the injuries had caused a small laceration to her kidney.

Mr Carney said: ‘He [the president] believes we need to take steps that protect Second Amendment rights of the American people but that ensure that we are not allowing weapons into the hands of individuals who should not, by existing law, obtain those weapons.'

He refused to name the rival he believes was involved, but said it showed the 'level of envy' on the restaurant scene while speaking on the Jonathan Ross show, to be broadcast on ITV tonight. Ramsay's new eatery is described as having a 'relaxed' atmosphere and 'modern European' menu which is ideal for 'brisk brunches and post-shopping pit stops through to lunch, dinners and after work cocktails.'

The facilities targeted, potentially numbering in the thousands, will be subject to a review and appeals process before any final decision is made. The list was developed based on low workload among post office employees, a small number of customers, and whether that location could be combined with other postal facilities nearby. The list to be released Tuesday has 3,653 facilities named, according to materials CNN obtained. They are categorized as follows: . GROUP 1: Less than $27,500 in annual revenue; less than 2 hours of workload daily (3,061) GROUP 2: Less than $600,000 in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 2 miles (385) GROUP 3: Less than $1 million in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 0.5 miles (188) GROUP 4: Offices currently suspended (19) Donohoe is also expected to provide details of a plan to increase joint marketing with other retailers as a way to improve customer access to postal services. A presentation obtained by CNN includes a drawing of a small grocery storefront, combined with signage suggesting the building is also a ""Village Post Office,"" complete with signs featuring the stylized logo of the postal service. In May, Donohoe told CNN, ""You've got a post office, a gas station, and a store; they're in a small town, the gas station and the store are struggling, we think we can provide service through contracts in many cases,"" that could cut operating costs for the Postal Service.

Blunder: Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital . A hospital which suppressed details of the blunders that led to a teenage girl’s death to avoid causing stress to staff was forced to back down yesterday. Victoria Harrison, 17, slowly bled to death in her hospital bed after an artery was severed during a routine appendix operation. The trainee hairdresser texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend shortly before she died. An inquest in December was told that Kettering General Hospital had uncovered 43 errors in the teenager’s care. But the Northamptonshire hospital insisted that publishing details of the blunders could ‘endanger the mental health’ of their staff. It released the internal report to Victoria’s devastated father Andrew Harrison, 57, and mother Tracy Foskett, 42, but said it had a right to withhold information from the public. Details were released – with staff names redacted – after the BBC appealed under the Freedom of Information Act against the hospital’s refusal to release its findings. An internal panel agreed it was in the public interest to reveal the mistakes and the report’s recommendations. The report says staff did not check Miss Harrison’s abdomen, routine observations were discontinued, there was no formal pain assessment, there was inaccurate recording of her resuscitation, the wrong surgeon was named on documentation and nurses’ conduct was unprofessional. It reveals that ten staff were disciplined, but none dismissed. The case comes after recent assurances from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt that whistleblowers will be protected as part of efforts to create a culture of ‘openness and transparency’ in the NHS, which the minister said was vital to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire scandal where up to 1,200 patients died needlessly.

There are now two spots that eclipse it. For a few short weeks, the French semi-autonomous territory of New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific held the top spot, having established the world's largest marine managed area in May. Covering 1.3 million square kilometers (502,000 square miles) -- the territory's entire economic zone -- the Natural Park of the Coral Sea protects the world's second longest double barrier reef and the world's largest marine lagoon, an underwater coliseum where the level of endemism (the number of species found nowhere else on earth) is off the charts. ""Because it lies in a temperate zone, the marine biodiversity of New Caledonia's reef is very peculiar,"" says Richard Farmer, director of the Aquarium Des Lagons in the capital Noumea. ""So we have an obligation to humanity to keep the reef pristine."" On June 17, the United States outdid New Caledonia when it declared an even bigger national park in the central South Pacific Ocean measuring 2 million square kilometers. But getting there is difficult.

Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The pilot of the second Continental Connection flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo, New York, reported ""moderate icing"" during the trip and ""made it to destination in Buffalo,"" said Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board. The second plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, like the plane that crashed Thursday night near the Buffalo airport, killing 49 people on board and one person on the ground. Also like the fatal flight, the aircraft was operated on the Continental Connection route by Colgan Air, Chealander said. Possible icing -- and how the aircraft and the flight crew performed if icing was an issue -- has become a focus in the aftermath of the crash of Flight 3407. The pilot and first officer of the flight discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the NTSB said after listening to the cockpit voice recorder. Chealander said Monday that he had been asked about possible icing on the aircraft's tail. ""If there's icing on the wings, there's icing on the tail,"" he said. ""The significance of that is yet to be determined."" The flight data recorder indicated the plane's deicing system was activated 11 minutes after takeoff from Newark and remained on until the crash, according to the NTSB. Chealander said investigators have recovered most of the pieces of that system and will examine those materials to determine whether the system was operating properly. Chealander also said questionnaires were being sent to every pilot who flew in the Buffalo vicinity the night of the crash to find out what icing conditions they might have encountered.

Tens of thousands of people marched through Hong Kong yesterday in support of China and to protest Occupy Central, a pro-democracy movement that says it will plan to stage a civil disobedience sit-in unless the Chinese government allows the Hong Kong public to nominate and vote for its next leader. Robert Chow, the organizer of Sunday's march, said it represented Hong Kong's desire to work ""peacefully"" with the Chinese government in Beijing on political reform. ""We want universal suffrage, but not at any cost,"" he told CNN Monday. The pro-government march followed the same route as Hong Kong's massive annual anti-government, pro-democracy rally on July 1, but the tenor was markedly different: Sunday's marchers were arranged into organized groups wearing matching t-shirts, some emblazoned with names of mainland Chinese organizations. Many waved Chinese flags. Paid protester claim . Local media swirled with reports of marchers getting paid or bused in to attend the pro-government march. One video (Cantonese) purportedly showed cash being handed out to marchers. Other images appeared to show marchers getting paid and enjoying free food in a dim-sum restaurant. Chow said he took the bribery accusations ""seriously"" and would ""investigate"" but maintained that no laws were broken. There were also conflicting reports on the size of the march. Chow said his group counted a ""quarter million"" marchers, but an estimate by University of Hong Kong statisticians put the number much lower, between 79,000 and 88,000. By contrast, July's pro-democracy rally drew between 154,000 and 172,000, according to the university. Pictures taken by reporters appeared to show a noticeably thinner crowd on Sunday than the crowd in July, but Chow said the difference was because ""we were marching very, very fast.""

9674c790966de344a4a34a39dc19a9bf2ef635fd,"(CNN)  -- Mexican smugglers trying to find new routes into the United States are turning increasingly to the Pacific Ocean for a short sail to the California coast, where they drop off illegal immigrants and marijuana, U.S. officials say. The Pacific Ocean around the California coastline is being used more often by Mexican smugglers. The water route has become particularly popular in the past year. ""We've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water,"" said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in San Diego, California. ""It's become very, very risky and difficult to cross by land. Smugglers try to jump where they think we're not looking."" U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Farris, the top-ranking Coast Guard official at the Port of San Diego, said interdictions of human cargo on the Pacific have doubled since last year. Drug busts -- all marijuana -- are even higher, he said. ""Drug interdictions are six times above what they were last year,"" Farris told CNN Wednesday. So far this year, he said, authorities have confiscated 60,000 pounds of marijuana and caught 400 people trying to sneak into the United States. The water route has become popular, he said, because ""the land border has been so severely closed by Customs and border agents."" That land route was particularly difficult Tuesday for smugglers who tried to speed three vans full of illegal immigrants through the San Ysidro border crossing between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, California. San Ysidro is the busiest land border crossing in the world, with up to 45,000 cars and 95,000 people passing through each day. One Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and two Customs and Border Protection agents opened fire, wounding two suspects, officials said. Another two people were injured when one of the vans crashed into another vehicle. More than 70 people aboard the three vans were captured as were two of the drivers, authorities said.

'He put his other hand on my right butt cheek. His hand was over my bra but through my shirt. 'It was very deliberate. I stepped back and he laughed'. She recalled pulling away from him and then making her way back in to the crowd. Now a mother-of-five, the woman told the court: 'I was in shock and I stayed away from him'.

But now the daily pint is to be delivered by the Germans across much of the country. Surrey-based Dairy Crest has sold all of its dairies and 3,000 milk floats to Bavaria’s Müller for £80million. End of an era: Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said it didn't matter who owns the company . Müller – which sells dairy products around the world – will take control of four dairies at Severnside, near Bristol, Chadwell Heath, east London, Foston, Derbyshire, and Hanworth, in Birmingham, as well as around 70 depots. Mark Allen, chief executive of Dairy Crest, said: ‘It may be owned by a German firm but consumers love the milkman – it doesn’t matter who owns the company.’ It marks an end of an era for Dairy Crest, as milk represented around 70 per cent of their business. The firm will now focus on their Country Life butter and Cathedral City cheese brands. Mr Allen added: ‘In the months ahead we will do all we can to minimise the uncertainty that we know today’s news will bring for the many people associated with our business.’ Dairy Crest, Britain’s largest dairy food company, has struggled to pass on higher raw milk prices it paid to farmers last year and has been losing customers to supermarket chains, which offer cheaper milk.

He's suffering from dementia and bedsores, and his body is shutting down at a hospital in Washington state, court documents say. On Wednesday, a Los Angeles County judge gave daughter Kerri Kasem the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine. The ruling reinstates the 82-year-old's end-of-life health directive. Kasem's doctor concluded that continuing the artificial nutrition and hydration would only ""at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already terribly uncomfortable dying process,"" said Kerri Kasem's lawyer, Troy Martin. ""The court's decision today upheld our father's explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive,"" Kerri Kasem said in a statement after the hearing. She was referring to a directive her father signed in 2007, saying he would not want to be kept alive if it ""would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning."" Steve Haney, an attorney for Kasem's second wife, Jean, slammed the judge's decision, calling it ""the functional equivalent of a death sentence.""

5a27b57613583c63221f6f5f694f2b041c74c48c,"(CNN) -- Hamas is pushing a different tactic in its conflict with Israel, urging Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes. The idea of pursuing an investigation into Israel by the international body is not new, but Hamas said on Saturday that it, too, has signed a document supporting such a move. ""Hamas has signed a document demanding Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) go to the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders as war criminals for massacres they committed against our people,"" Hamas spokesman and senior official Izzat al-Risheq said on Twitter. The support from Hamas is significant because it could come at a cost to the group itself. An investigation into war crimes could expose Hamas for its own violations. Abbas, speaking in Cairo, said that all Palestinian factions would need to support such a bid before making the decision to go to the ICC. The Palestinians are not currently under the jurisdiction of the ICC, but would be if they sign the court's Rome Statute, the treaty that established the court. Back in May, a group of 17 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, signed a letter to Abbas encouraging him to join the ICC. The United States and Israel, among some other nations, have pressured Abbas not to take this step, arguing that it would harm peace talks. Hamas' announcement comes a day after one of the group's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June. Hamas Political Bureau member Saleh Aruri added that the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action. The kidnappings were not approved by Hamas leadership or its military wing, he said, stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility.

Plus, tossing out food is expensive! The average American household discards between $500 and $2,000 worth of food a year. But there are clever ways to minimize waste, by storing food carefully or preserving it at its peak to enjoy later, says Sherri Brooks Vinton, author of ""Put 'Em Up,"" a book about preserving food. Here, a few of our favorites. Bread . The problem: You bought more loaves than you need. Use it now: Cooks the world over have come up with smart ways to use old bread. A super-quick one: croutons. Cut bread into cubes, toss with a little olive oil and salt, and toast in a 275-degree oven for about 20 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden. Cool, then store in an airtight container for up to two weeks. They're delicious in soups and salads, or crushed and sprinkled over pasta. Save it for later: While it's still fresh, place a sliced loaf right in the freezer. Then, pull out slices as you need them and pop them in the toaster. ""People don't think of the freezer as a preserving mechanism, but it is,"" Vinton says. Health.com: Essential items for a healthy pantry . Fresh fruit . The problem: Buying fruit in season is wise. ""The vitamin content of seasonal produce is at its peak,"" says Christina Munsell, research associate at the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. But we often buy more than we can eat. Use it now: You don't need a recipe to make fruit salad -- most kinds go together naturally. Just cut up what you have (skip bananas, which go mushy; see the tip below). Add one-quarter teaspoon of vanilla, a generous squeeze of citrus (to slow browning), and a drizzle of honey. Set the bowl front and center in your fridge; it'll be the first thing everyone sees when they go snack-hunting. 40% of U.S. food wasted, report says .

Mario Balotelli appears to drift through games but he's actually working harder than you'd think. He covered 5.2 miles in his 79 minutes against Chelsea. That is equivalent to 5.8 miles across 90 minutes – which just happens to be the average distance covered by Luis Suarez in games against the top four last season. Mario Balotelli may not be finding the net with the same regularity as Luis Suarez did at Liverpool, but he is running the same as the Uruguayan did against the top four teams last season . 2. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season - and the left back, who made his Wales debut in the summer, has now also proved he can play as a central defender. The 23-year-old product of the club's youth system performed brilliantly alongside Fabricio Coloccini in the 2-0 win at West Brom, keeping new England star Saido Berahino to just one shot on goal. His 13 clearances were more than the rest of Newcastle's defenders put together. Geordie Paul Dummett's emergence has been a huge bonus for Alan Pardew this season . 3. Gareth Barry's nasty injury at Sunderland gave Darron Gibson a chance to return to Premier League action – and the former Manchester United midfielder seized the opportunity. The 26-year-old, out for 11 months after cruciate ligament surgery, had played just eight minutes of League football so far. But after replacing Barry at Sunderland with just 13 minutes gone he performed like he'd not been away. No Premier League player all weekend hit more accurate passes in the attacking half than the 52 that Gibson produced – just a shame none of them got turned into a goal in the 1-1 draw.

The firms announced an unpredecented project to release more than 100 apps aimed at everything from healthcare to banking. They will also join forces to try and sell iPads and iPhones to business users. The partnership, which was six months in the making, will offer services geared at security, mobile device management and big data and analytics. The company also plans to develop cloud services optimized for Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The two firms will release more than 100 apps targeting industry specific issues in retail, healthcare, banking, travel, transportation and telecommunications. Until now Apple's expansion has been driven by employees bringing in their own devices and requesting corporate support, the so-called bring-your-own-IT trend. Partnering with IBM could help address lingering concerns about smartphone software security and data privacy, and help the pair wrestle business away from firms like Blackberry. The announcement, just two days before IBM releases its second quarter earnings, comes as the company attempts to shift its focus to software and services as its hardware unit continues to slump, and follows a string of mobile software acquisitions.

Ibragim Todashev, who died during the interview with authorities, not only confessed to his direct role in slashing the throats of three people in Waltham, Massachusetts, but also fingered Tsarnaev in the deaths, the official said Wednesday. Todashev was being questioned about the slayings and his acquaintance with Tsarnaev. Todashev attacked an FBI agent, who shot him dead, a federal law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the case told CNN. ""He used some kind of weapon,"" the official said, and that prompted the FBI agent to shoot the suspect. A second law enforcement official confirmed Todashev made the confession. The unsolved triple murder received renewed interest after it was learned that Tsarnaev was sparring partners at a local gym with one of the victims. Source: 2011 slayings of Tsarnaev friend, 2 others revisited . Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force. Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a ""symbolic gesture,"" and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene. Todashev told investigators the men were killed during a drug ripoff because he and Tsarnaev were afraid they would be able to identify them and tell police what happened, according to a law enforcement source. So far, no link has been found between Todashev and the Boston Marathon bombings. However, the FBI is looking into the many connections between Todashev and Tsarnaev, whose radicalization allegedly led to the Boston bombings.

A schoolboy was awarded £15,197 in compensation after he sustained a 'tiny cut to the eyebrow' when a teacher threw a DVD case to him. The plastic case accidentally hit the secondary school pupil in the head, with the boy’s family successfully claiming the five-figure pay-out from Essex County Council. The council said the member of staff was attempting to pass the DVD cover to the pupil but 'unintentionally threw it with more force than expected and it accidentally hit him'. It said: 'The damages were agreed in accordance with the guidelines of the Judicial College Guidelines. 'The claimant suffered a scar which was permanent and represented a moderate cosmetic deformity.' The council paid out £7,900 for the family's solicitors' legal costs, £6,750 in damages and £547 in NHS costs. Critics have . now complained of a ‘compensation culture’ in Essex schools. In total £65,586 of taxpayers' money was awarded by Essex council to pupils that successfully sued over injuries between 2011 and 2013, including one who received £16,812 after hurting his hip falling on wet stairs, according to The Sun. Essex teachers are suing schools, too. Thirty-four payouts were handed to injured teachers in the county between 2011 and 2013 – and who received a total of £1.05million. One teacher was awarded £230,000 after he slipped on a sachet of tomato ketchup in a school corridor. He suffered severe injuries in the fall as he was walking out of the staff room at a secondary school in Essex.

Over the weekend, the page shared a picture of a woman breast-feeding at her graduation, prompting a chorus of social media cheers and jeers. While much of the reaction has focused on whether the picture is appropriate, the women behind ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" say its message is lost in the social media chatter. ""It's important for black women to see other black women breast-feeding,"" said Nicole Sandiford, who started ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" in 2010 as a blog and Facebook group. ""Seeing other black women breast-feeding provides a sense of broad community and support for those who are trying to do it."" If that sounds weird to you, look no further than a recent post on the Facebook page asking, ""If someone tried to talk you out of breast-feeding, what were their reasons?"" Comments vary from, ""My mom said that's what poor people did in the old days"" to ""You won't make enough milk"" or ""It's something that white people do."" That wasn't Sandiford's experience growing up in a black family outside of the United States, where it wasn't unusual to see women breast-feed openly in public. She remembers seeing her mother breast-feed her sister and knew that one day she, too, would breast-feed her children. When she turned to the Internet in 2009 for support after her son's birth, she noticed that most images and personal stories did not include black women. Or, when conversations included black women, they focused on how they breast-feed at lower rates than other racial groups. ""I said to myself, 'Hmm, we seem to be missing from this broader conversation,' "" said Sandiford, a married mother of two in Charlotte, North Carolina.

4380de937e5e9c5ddec71973b7c1e9dd94e1f6be,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Home to some 70 million Muslims, Nigeria is stepping up efforts to capitalize on the growing popularity of the one of the world's fastest-growing financial sectors: Islamic banking. Earlier this year the Central Bank of Nigeria announced a final set of regulations which introduced Islamic banking to the country. CNN's Christian Purefoy discussed the sector's potential with Hajara Adeola, managing director of Lotus Capital, one of the groups helping to pave the way for Islamic finance in Nigeria. Adeola says there is a growing appetite for this form of banking. ""It is working in Nigeria and there is a lot of interest in doing Islamic banking, in West Africa in particular,"" she says. Spread across the Middle East and other parts of the world, a slew of Islamic financial institutions have been offering interest-free services that advocates say can provide a more sustainable alternative to conventional banking practices. The industry, which exists in more than 50 countries, is estimated to be worth around $1 trillion and has the potential to eventually be worth $5 trillion, according to ratings agency Moody's. Charging and paying interest is not allowed in Islamic finance because it is prohibited under Sharia law. Instead, if a bank is providing finance for an infrastructure project, for example, the bank and customer agree to share the risk of investment and divide any earnings. ""One of the most well known (principles) is the lack of interest or usury, so you can't own a return simply for having money -- which is what interest is,"" Adeola says. ""You would have to somehow employ that money into productive use and then you can earn a return on that money."" Islamic banks are not allowed to trade in financial risk areas or deal in mortgage-backed securities or credit-default swaps. Investing in Islamically unacceptable businesses such as alcohol and cigarette makers, casinos and adult-entertainment companies is also forbidden.

But leading medical groups remain ambivalent, and opponents are now trying to mobilize for upcoming votes in three states. Florida will vote on whether to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in November. In New York and Georgia, the state legislatures are debating medical marijuana, while the District of Columbia City Council voted Tuesday to decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot. Meanwhile, two more states -- Oregon and Alaska -- are expected to follow the lead of Colorado and Washington and put full legalization on the ballot in 2014. And in the year-plus since the Colorado and Washington votes, public opinion has swung sharply in favor of loosening marijuana laws. ""That caught everyone, even advocates, by surprise,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance. In January, a CNN/ORC International survey found 55% support for legalization, with 44% opposing it. National polls shifted by about 10 percentage points between late 2012 and late 2013, with support for legalization climbing to roughly the same level seen in the CNN poll, Nadelmann said. ""A lot of people just began to relax and see the sky's not going to fall. All we're doing is moving a booming market from the underground to the legal world,"" he said. Those trends were seen even in states like Louisiana, where Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal told CNN in February that he'd be open to the ""tightly regulated"" use of medical marijuana. ""If you look at public opinion polls, support for legalizing medical marijuana is over 70% nationally, even in the South,"" Nadelmann said.

Luciano Aviello, 41, made the statement during a videotaped interview with Knox's lawyers. He said he had tried to write the Italian court several times to say that Knox and the others were innocent, but no one ever contacted him, defense and prosecution officials said. A source close to the case tells CNN that Aviello, who has been in and out of prison since age 17, was out of prison, living down the street from Knox and Meredith Kercher and under a ""protection program"" at the time of the murder. Aviello is serving 17 years in an Italian prison because of his association with the Camorra crime family. According to Italian media reports and Britain's Daily Mail, he has testified against the mob at several trials, always from behind a screen to shield his identity. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 25, were found guilty in December 2009 of Kercher's murder and are serving sentences of 26 and 25 years, respectively. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, plead guilty to the murder and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. In March, Aviello contacted Knox's attorneys, who visited him in prison to learn more about his story. Aviello told Knox's lawyers during the videotaped interviews that his brother, who was staying with him at the time of Kercher's murder, came home one night and said he had killed a girl during a botched robbery. British and Italian media have reported the brother's whereabouts are unknown and neither the lawyers for Knox nor the prosecution would comment further.

The ""selfie"" went viral online almost immediately. But you could be forgiven for not knowing who this blonde beauty taking a photo with a smartphone of herself with two political power houses is, unless you are Danish, like myself, or up to date on your current affairs. Many newspapers are calling into question whether it was appropriate for ""Gucci Helle,"" as she is called by many Danes for her sense of style, to take a ""selfie"" during Tuesday's memorial service. The Times wrote that Obama tested the limits of ""funeral etiquette"" (despite the memorial not being a funeral) with the self-portrait. Although they may have been acting less than gracefully at the moment the snap was taken, they did seem to be enjoying each other's company and Thorning-Schmidt just couldn't resist the urge to document the moment for herself. She may after all never have the opportunity again. Many Danes seem not to have taken the whole thing as seriously as some of the newspapers in Britain.

Some Danes are bemused by the global reaction to the selfie -- as it hasn't hit their front pages yet -- perhaps reflecting a more laid-back approach in general, as was displayed by their PM in Johannesburg.

The incident occurred during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at a Kent County showground southeast of London. A man who apparently was fired from a cannon died on Monday after a safety net failed to work, a police statement said.

""My officers will be looking into this tragic incident to try and establish what happened,"" acting chief inspector Steve Griffith said. Health and safety officials from a local government council also are part of the investigation, Griffith said. ""We need to understand why this poor man died so that we can take the appropriate steps,"" he said. The victim's parents have been notified, police said, but his body has not been formally identified and so authorities are not releasing his identify. The stunt show has been touring since 1991. It features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes. ""Scott and the team are still reeling with shock and grief over the loss of their colleague and fellow stunt performer in the tragic accident at the show yesterday afternoon,"" the show said on its website ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time.""

It was installed to protect the Kingdom of Mercia, which is now known as the Midlands, from an invasion by Welsh forces.

Speaking to NBC News in an interview that aired Wednesday, Snowden claimed that he'd reached out to the office while working as an National Security Agency contractor to report what he saw as an abuse of power by the agency. ""I reported that there were real problems with the way the NSA was interpreting its legal authorities,"" he told NBC's Brian Williams. In the e-mail exchange released by the NSA Thursday, Snowden requests clarification about training material he'd received, asking whether executive orders can override federal laws. The general counsel's office responded to Snowden's e-mail, saying that executive orders have the ""force and effect of law"" but cannot override a statute. ""Please give me a call if you would like to discuss further,"" the e-mail concludes. In his interview with NBC, Snowden said that after raising concerns, he essentially was told to ""stop asking questions."" He described his contact with the general counsel's office as an indication of what he said were his efforts to go through official channels to raise his concerns about the NSA before leaking classified documents. In a statement Thursday, the NSA said the e-mail exchange it released was the only communication found and there was no evidence Snowden followed up. ""We have searched for additional indications of outreach from him in those areas and to date have not discovered any engagements related to his claims,"" the statement said. Snowden said Thursday that the e-mail exchange released by the NSA was ""a strangely tailored and incomplete leak,"" telling The Washington Post that it ""only shows the NSA feels it has something to hide.""

Harry Reid and his Republican opponent, James Santini. ""Mr. Reid's performance in Las Vegas could well turn on the Mormon vote,"" the correspondent noted, spotlighting Reid's religion. ""Though only some 12% of Nevadans are Mormons, they punch more than their weight. Less than half the state's eligible voters bother to register, but Mormons almost always do, which gives them about a quarter of the likely turnout."" Members of the Jesus Christ Church of Latter Day Saints still punch more than their weight in Nevada politics, holding a broad array of elected offices and deep sway within the business community. But the portrait of Nevada as a sparsely populated desert locale where elections hinge on the Mormon vote now seems quaint. The state's dramatic population growth over the last two decades -- two-thirds of all registered voters in Nevada registered to vote after the 2000 presidential election, for instance -- has diluted the influence of Mormon voters on statewide elections. Nevada had just 375,000 registered voters in 1998 when Reid won his first Senate race. Now, more than a million voters are on the books. There are nearly 700,000 voters in Clark County alone.

Many are fleeing persecution from war-torn areas like Sudan and Eritrea. The threat to their lives pushes them to undertake the dangerous journey via smugglers' routes to Israel.

When pressed during an interview in her Tel Aviv home, Livni wouldn't say whether there is evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has directed the use of any chemical weapons. But she said this development poses a direct threat to Israel, which shares a border with Syria. Livni told CNN that ""the appearance is that it's not going to be only in Syria, but that Hezbollah can reach all these chemical weapons and use them against Israel in the future."" Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the Assad regime is further destabilized. President Obama just landed in Israel for a two-day trip, and two national security issues dominate the agenda: the nuclear showdown with Iran and the growing crisis with Syria. On both fronts, Livni says, U.S. leadership can make the crucial difference. ""The United States has the tools in order to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon and in order to stop all this situation in Syria,"" she said, and she insisted that this is the time to act. ""It is not a favor to the state of Israel. This is something that represents the interests of the United States as well,"" she said. Israeli minister says she hopes U.S. helps restart peace talks . In February, Israel attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. That assault did not involve chemical weapons, but clearly their use would increase the stakes for Israel.

A natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean is responsible for the slowdown in the pace of global warming so far this century, according to a new study. Scientists believe a series of naturally . occurring La Nina weather events in the Pacific in recent years, which . bring cooler waters to the surface, have masked the heat-trapping . effect caused by greenhouse gases. The slowdown has raised hopes among some governments that it will be easier and cheaper to achieve long-term goals for limiting temperature rises to avert more heatwaves, droughts, floods and rising sea levels. Strong currents in the Pacific Ocean have brought cooler water to the surface, slowing the pace of global warming, scientists believe . 'Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability, tied specifically to a La Nina-like decadal cooling,' according to the study by Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie at the University of California, San Diego. 'Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future, the multi-decadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase,' they wrote in the journal Nature. Past studies have linked the slowdown in the pace of warming this century to factors such as a build-up of sun-dimming air pollution in the atmosphere or a decline in the sun's output. Others suggest that the deep oceans may be absorbing more heat. Nine of the 10 warmest years since records began in the mid-19th century have been since 2000, with 1998 the exception, according to U.N. World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Even so, the pace of warming has slowed from the 1980s and 1990s even though greenhouse gas emissions have hit record highs. There have been four years with La Nina cooling events in the Pacific since 1998 and only two with the opposite, El Nino, when the Pacific waters warm, according to WMO data.

The astonishing development will save  the lives of thousands of patients with advanced melanoma, who usually die within months of being diagnosed. The new treatment, which will bring hope to  hundreds of thousands of people in Britain with terminal conditions, involves the combination of two  different types of drug that ‘reboot’ the immune system. The first is ipilimumab – or ‘ipi’. According to research presented to the European congress in Amsterdam yesterday, 17 per cent of patients are cured by this drug alone. But many more – perhaps more than half – could be ‘clinically cured’ by combining them with even newer drugs called anti-PD1s which break down cancer cells’ defences. Professor Alexander Eggermont of the Institut Gustave Roussy in France said: ‘[Advanced] melanoma could become a curable disease for perhaps more than 50 per cent of patients within five to 10 years.’ He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘If I’d made this bizarre prediction five years ago, people would have said I was mad.

Prosecutors relied on the woman's testimony, text messages and e-mails to prove their case, said Natasha Ramkisson, a spokeswoman for the national prosecuting authority. Moss told the court that Cwele offered them more than $3,500. Another woman agreed to pick up the package, and was arrested in Brazil, where she is now serving an eight-year sentence for drug trafficking, Ramkisson said.

Darius Guppy, 49, who has known Boris Johnson since they were students together at Eton and then Oxford, was so enraged by a newspaper article about him that he believed 'humiliated' his wife, Sunderland-born Patricia, he flew from his home in Cape Town to exact revenge. Notoriously vengeful Guppy, who served time in prison for faking a jewel heist, tracked the journalist down to his home, lay in wait for him and then knocked him to the ground as he left the house before tipping a sack of horse manure over him. Darius Guppy, pictured with wife Patricia, sought revenge on a journalist over a perceived insult . In an article boasting about his attack on the man, Guppy - a former friend and Oxford peer of both Boris Johnson and Earl Spencer, wrote: 'I waited for him to emerge from his house, chased him, and then, having knocked him to the ground, emptied over his head a sack of horse manure rendered slurry by the addition of bottled water - a concoction made possible courtesy of Hyde Park Riding School and the springs of Evian.

'And humiliate him is exactly what I did, in front of his neighbours who had poured out on to the street at the sound of his screams.' Writing in the New Statesman, Guppy said he had two friends with him filming the entire incident, but he says he chose not to put the footage onto the internet as he did not wish to hurt the journalist's family. His article, entitled Who Will Bully The Bullies? names neither the journalist nor the article that upset him, although earlier this year an article appeared in a broadsheet newspaper that cast an aspersion on Mrs Guppy's past.

""The Republican Party of Orange County condemns racism in any form, and this censure is consistent with that position,"" the group said in a statement.

Last month, she found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an e-mail she says she received from a friend.

Driven by the same desire, Slovenian frequent flier Bostjan Zagar has come up with the answer -- a foot-powered scooter-suitcase known as Olaf. ""The idea comes from having to catch the next connection flight in three minutes when the gate is on the other side of the world and you need to move faster than those moving walkways,"" Zagar tells CNN. Disappointed with available luggage solutions to this problem, Zagar used his background as an automotive engineer and his time waiting for flights to sketch up an alternative. Now, after three years of ""testing, testing, testing,"" and a soon-to-finish fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, the Olaf is ready to hit the streets. It's available in three models: an airline-approved carry-on suitcase with a built-in kick scooter; a backpack with kick scooter and a kick scooter that can carry another bag. All three feature wheely suitcase-style collapsible handles and can double up as a hand trolleys.

Needless to say, his suitcase scooters are all fitted with brakes. Even with this sensible feature, Zagar says travelers in some parts of the world may be wary to step aboard.

3e90538e055b825f62b0bc687faa4a577bc96eeb,"(CNN) -- Greece is hoping a derelict airport on the outskirts of Athens -- one which has sparked a keen contest among international investors -- will help solve its debt woes. Hellinikon airport, the sale of which initially piqued the interest of U.S. business tycoon Donald Trump, could be vital to reversing the fortunes of the Greek economy. Greece is awaiting a financial lifeline of 31.5 billion euros [$40.3 billion] from international creditors, following the approval of a 13.5 billion euro austerity package by Greek lawmakers earlier this month. Alongside aid packages and austerity measures, Greece is selling off assets from gas reserves to sewage works as it tries to gain control of its 340 billion euro pile of debt. And while the potential sale of Greece's coveted islands caught early -- and controversial -- headlines, hopes are now resting on the dilapidated airport as a potential economic savior. Four property developers -- Elbit Cochin Island Ltd, Lamda Development, London and Regional Properties and Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment -- have been shortlisted by the Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund (HRADF) to win exclusive rights to the site. The bidders did not respond or were unavailable for immediate comment. A fund spokesman declined to disclose the airport's potential purchase price but says redeveloping the land will cost around 6 billion euros. The fund has projected a redevelopment of the site will bolster Greece's gross domestic product, which has contracted by 39.5 billion euros in the past five years to 171.4 billion euros, by 0.3% over the next ten years.

An amateur beekeeper with a 6-year-old son has died after what appears to be a fatal allergic reaction to 40 stings. April Taylor was wearing gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family's back yard in Willard, Utah. Those precautions did not cover her entirely, however, as many beekeepers regularly wear full suits and high boots to insure that they are entirely covered when they interact with the insects. Mrs Taylor, 31, came into her house on Tuesday May 13 and showed her husband Zac how she had been stung 30 or 40 times. He told the Deseret News that she said she seemed fine but later that day she went back outside and he found her passed out. She was rushed to the local hospital but died three days later at Ogden Regional Medical Center. 'We all started thinking, ""Well, how did this happen? … Killer bees or what? But I guess after she had got stung, her husband called the beekeeper, and he came and figured out there was no queen bee in the hive,""' Zak Taylor's uncle Bruce Vail told the paper. 'He said if there's no queen bee in the hive, they get really protective of their hive and they just swarmed her.' According to her Facebook page, Mrs Taylor also suffered from multiple sclerosis.

Big Day Out fans are mourning the loss of one of the most highly anticipated music festivals after organisers announced the annual event won't be back in Australia or New Zealand next year. 'While we intend to bring back the festival in future years, we can confirm there will not be a Big Day Out in 2015,' American owners of the event, C3 Presents, confirmed on Thursday in a statement. The first inkling that the festival hit financial troubles came after promoters said earlier this year the event wouldn't return to Perth in 2015 after poor ticket sales. Rumours of this year's poor attendance figures and a court dispute between C3 and its former owner AJ Maddah was also reported by Fairfax Media earlier this year. Maddah later said the Big Day Out was cancelled because of a shortage of headline acts, when a Twitter follower asked him: 'is there a shortage of headliners at the moment? Every O/S festival i see headlined by Outkast'. 'Yes. There's a shortage of headliners on cycle this year. Hence BDO taking year off,' he replied.

The Englishman blew away overnight leader Miguel Angel Jimenez with six birdies and only one dropped shot in 14 holes to take his tally to 13-under-par for the tournament. But a huge thunder and lightning storm meant the early abandonment of play and forced tournament organisers to contemplate the possibility of a reduced format in the penultimate event of the European Tour season.

The 39-year-old, who was five under for the day when he was called off, continues to thrive after the equipment change made in the wake of a disappointing Ryder Cup. His mediocre Cup showing was the latest lowpoint in a year dominated by injuries and poor form, which saw him slide from 12th to 44th in the rankings – leaving him at risk of his lowest year-end ranking since September 2006.

Plenty of Arsenal fans will be looking at him and asking: ‘Why isn’t he doing that job in our midfield?’ They have a point. Sam Allardyce saw a good opportunity and grabbed it.

He was only 17 but he went straight into training with the first-team group. Along with Abou Diaby, he was earmarked as a potential successor to Patrick Vieira. Song’s talent was obvious but he still needed a lot of work and Arsene Wenger is one of the best at developing young players. The focus with Song was always passing. Wenger likes midfielders to open up their body and receive the ball on the half-turn, giving them the chance to glance over their shoulder before receiving the ball to feet.

f72f6a2380350bb170d56036cd9bcdc8d667f1f7,"(CNN) -- Can anyone stop Bayern Munich? That's the question following the German side's 2-0 victory over Arsenal Wednesday in the last-16 of the Champions League. Already 16 points clear in the German Bundesliga and unbeaten in 21 league games, Bayern is looking like the team to beat once again. Bayern, which is hoping to become the first team to successfully defend the title since the competition was revamped in 1992, claimed a hard-fought win thanks to Toni Kroos' second half strike and Thomas Muller's header. It could and indeed should have been different but Arsenal wasted a glorious opportunity in the early stages when Mesut Ozil missed from the penalty spot. The home side's misery was compounded eight minutes before the break when goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off after bringing down Arjen Robben in the penalty area. David Alaba stood up to take the spot kick but could only strike his effort against the post. Bayern, which won 3-1 at Emirates Stadium at the same stage last season, began to lay siege to the Arsenal goal. And with nine minutes of the second half having elapsed, Kross unleashed a sumptuous strike which flew past substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The visitors refused to let up in their pressure and Robben had an effort well saved when his shot appeared destined for the far corner. Pep Guardiola's side did finally secure the second goal it so badly craved when substitute Muller headed home Philipp Lahm's cross with three minutes of normal time remaining. There was still time for Kroos, who scored in the game between the clubs last season, to hit the post with a measured drive. Arsenal will now head to Munich on March 11 with hopes of pulling off a repeat of their 2-0 victory last season. The same result would give Arsene Wenger's men the opportunity to take the tie into extra-time but it faces an uphill struggle against a rampant Bayern.

The pair are said to have stolen a bag containing a wallet and embarked on a shopping trip, leaving Mr Strickland dying on the street outside the family home. Prosecutors say William Jr spent the stolen money on a new phone, gym shoes and tattoos, while neighbours reported that Janet Strickland bought her grandson a bright red Pontiac car as well as furniture for herself. The pair are charged with first-degree murder and armed robbery and were denied bail. Janet Strickland was not in court Saturday because she was being treated for lung disease and high blood pressure in hospital. Assistant State's Attorney Jacqueline Kwilos told reporters the pair 'discussed on numerous occasions killing the victim.

77be1e2afe7448516432cd228f7f3974d0dce6c1,"(CNN) -- In the white sand beaches of Yoff, the small fishing town just north of the Senegalese capital Dakar, a seemingly endless line of brightly colored boats dots the Atlantic seaside. It was here, about four years ago, that Spanish designer Ramon Llonch was first struck by the mysterious symbols and intricate patterns adorning the hand-painted wooden vessels. ""I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned,"" remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country. ""I was captivated by that colorful mosaic of life with the women selling the fish and the men approaching the shore,"" he adds. Read this: African firm invests billions in U.S. Looking at the old, weathered canoes, Llonch started wondering whether he could find a new use for them while preserving the history of their owners. His idea was to work with skillful local craftsmen and breathe new life into the traditional ""pirogues"" by transforming them into hand-made furniture. And that's how Artlantique was born, a company repurposing boats that are no longer sea worthy into upcycled fittings -- anything from whimsical chairs and coffee tables to one-of-a-kind cabinets and even foosball tables. ""It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa,"" says Llonch. ""Every time you see this furniture, you have a piece of the soul and the history of these fishermen,"" adds the 52-year-old designer. Long journey . From the waters off the coast of Senegal, through the Dakar-based workshop, to several stores across the world, the journey of transforming the old fishing boats into furniture is far from easy. Artlantique employs 12 craftsmen, including a co-ordinator who is in regular contact with the local fishermen about the purchase of those boats whose life span on the ocean waters has ended -- usually after 40 to 50 years of use.

A Cornell University student has made a series of painful conclusions in his research into stings by letting honey bees attack his own body. Michael Smith subjected himself to several stings a day to his face, arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs. After weeks of research Smith found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable, the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril. Science of stings: Cornell student Michael Smith researched the most painful places for a bee to attack . His usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser. 'We speculated it probably really would . hurt to get stung in the testicles. Two days later, by . chance, I did get stung there. It didn't hurt as much as I expected it . to,' he told the Independent. Smith measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful: . 1) Nostril  - 9.0             6) Cheek - 7.0 . 2) Upper lip - 8.7          7) Armpit - 6.7 . 3) Penis - 7.3               8) Nipple - 6.7 . 4) Scrotum - 7.0              9) Middle finger tip - 6.7 . 5) Palm - 7.0               10) Abdomen - 6.7 . Intrigued by his 'eureka' moment, Smith chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain. He then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him. Like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so, over the course of 38 days, he administered five stings a day. Each body part was stung three times during the experiment, and the pain level was given a mark out of 10. Because the experiment needed a control, he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day's research.

Cupich, of Spokane, Washington, will take over leadership of the Archdiocese of Chicago in November, succeeding Cardinal Francis George, who has been battling cancer and has said he believes the disease will end his life. Cupich is Pope Francis' first major appointment in the U.S. and the clearest indication yet of the direction he wants to steer American church leaders.

Chicago archbishops are usually elevated to cardinal and are therefore eligible to vote for the next pope. George is especially admired in the church's conservative wing as an intellectual who took a hard line against abortion and gay marriage. Francis has said he wants church leaders to focus more on mercy and compassion and less on hot-button issues. At a Chicago news conference Saturday, Cupich pledged to consult with local Catholics as he leads them.

During flooding, items left in them may be damaged and not accessible for weeks. • Have thick tarps and roofing tacks in case you lose shingles from the wind.

Video from the scene first showed the rescue of the officer. A firetruck ladder extended over a cliff. Then what looked to be the second individual was raised from the gorge on a stretcher. The body was still, and wrapped in white sheets. It was loaded into a waiting ambulance. The SIU has assigned seven investigators and two forensic investigations to the case. The agency conducts criminal investigations into circumstances involving police and civilians that have ended in serious injury, death or allegations of sexual assault.","An officer also fell into the gorge, but survived with a broken femur .

d27f9d1721a93ac94f54ecb64a7344d5ccbefb4c,"(CNN) -- At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man. It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children, a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004. Since that time, three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire, including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution. Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks, just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations. The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992. ""I don't sleep at night because of a lot of this,"" Brokofsky said. ""I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed. I don't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake, that the facts aren't what they could've been."" Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home. She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana, Texas, where the fire took place. ""I do have doubts now,"" she said. ""I mean, we can only go with what we knew at the time, but I don't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true. It may not be true now. And I don't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did."" ""When you're sitting there with all those facts, there was nothing else we could see,"" she said. ""Now I don't know. I can't tell you he's innocent, I can't say 100 percent he's guilty."" Brokofsky had another revelation. She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family's close relationship with key witness and then-Corsica","Cameron Todd Willingham maintained his innocence up until his execution in 2004 .

786eb472fc6d5075258e995a72dfa54c7b248ec2,"Washington (CNN) -- Behind-the-scenes dealing over reviving stalled gun control legislation will get a push next week when Sen. Joe Manchin, a strong proponent of expanding background checks, plans to meet individually with lawmakers, a Senate source tells CNN. The key question the conservative West Virginia Democrat wants answered is whether a ""minimal change"" to a compromise background check proposal that he co-authored but which failed to gain enough support in a vote last month would entice more senators to support it, the source said. Since the proposal he negotiated with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania faltered, senators who voted against it have been hounded in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks. Sen. Kelly Ayotte has been the most high-profile target of such confrontations. The New Hampshire Republican was questioned at an event by Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, a school principal slain in the Newtown massacre last December. Lafferty asked ""why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school isn't as important"" as inconveniencing gun sellers. Lafferty was sent to Ayotte's event by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, one of several gun control groups using the current congressional recess to take the gun control message out of Washington. And she followed that up with interviews with TV networks. The source said this sort of pressure from outside groups is a key to any hopes of swaying senators who may be open to supporting a modified proposal. In addition to confronting senators in person, groups have run ads against lawmakers who voted against the Toomey-Manchin compromise and have supported senators who supported it. The husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in Arizona, wrote an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle challenging the National Rifle Association over its opposition to expanded backgro","Co-author of expanded background checks proposal to meet with senators next week .

A young farmer ploughs a field in preparation to grow rice in Dalla, about 20 kms south of Yangon on July 9, 2008. Rice production in the cyclone-affected areas of Ayeyarwaddy and Yangon, the largest city and former capital of Myanmar, is expected to be 50 percent of last year's, according to the report issued by the U.N.

More than 5 million people fall below the food poverty line and emergency food aid is still needed in cyclone-affected areas, the report said. The cyclone also hurt the cattle and fishing industries, contributing to the food crisis. ""Humanitarian assistance has not restored the production capacity of small to medium-sized farms,"" He Changchui, FAO's Asia-Pacific regional chief, said in a written statement.

A poignant 133-year-old letter has revealed details of the last stand of Australia's most famous outlaw, Ned Kelly, describing the moment bullets 'slid off him like hail' as he faced a bloody battle with police. In the first 'everyman' account of the Glenrowan Siege, a young bank teller named Donald Sutherland tells how he witnessed Kelly being captured and, in the letter to his parents in Scotland, details the shootout with police on June 28, 1880.

'Ned's armour alone weighed 97 pounds,' Mr Sutherland writes. 'The police thought he was a fiend, seeing their rifle bullets were sliding off him like hail,"" Sutherland wrote.

If it succeeds, it will create a top ecological attraction, reduce economic hardships and help modernize a community. It's the Giant Flag of South Africa, and it's an ambitious project by almost any measure. Located in the Camdeboo Municipality of Karoo, an arid region between Cape Town and Johannesburg, it will transform a patch of desert into a living national flag spanning about 163 acres, the size of 66 soccer fields. Some 2.5 million red, yellow, blue and green desert plants, including cacti and spekboom, will be arranged in a pattern like that of South Africa's flag. The flag's black triangular area will contain a 4-megawatt solar-panel field, generating much-needed electricity for the region. The idea is simple and elegant: use green tourism to fight poverty. Guy Lieberman came up with the idea after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, when the South Africans played host and were united by the spirit of their flag. His employer, FCB South Africa, a communications firm, asked him to come up with a legacy project related to the flag. It's about ""how we treat ourselves, nature, our built environment, and how we choose to view our common future on the planet,"" Lieberman said. Organizers say the succulent plants will reintroduce nutrients to the soil and sequester upwards of 200 tons of carbon every year. With the looming threat of climate change, this can only be a good thing. Meanwhile, the solar panels are expected to power the equivalent of 4,000 homes. Organizers hope to complete the flag in 2017. ""The Giant Flag aims for a blend of ecological balance and social stability. One could call this compassionate capitalism,"" Lieberman said.

He later diagnosed the woman with hormonal imbalance, chronic pain, anxiety and fatigue 'without any supporting medical justification,' the order states, and prescribed her a cocktail of Adderall, Xanax, hydrocodone and B-12 shots. On at least one occasion, McBath allegedly injected a white liquid into the patient’s vagina, telling her it would give her a stronger sex drive. In the course of her treatment, the 35-year-old woman came to McBath's house and he instructed her to put on his wife's clothes, which she refused to do. The doctor and patient drank alcohol and used cocaine. The order states the woman then passed out and later woke up in McBath's bed.

And, you know those little grooves in runways that channel away standing water? NASA again. America's space agency isn't just about space. It also develops ways to make our airliners safer and more efficient. Guess what? You may have been flying with NASA technology for years, and didn't even know it. Shape-shifting wings? They're coming . Now, an ongoing project could radically change the way airliners look and, more importantly, save hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fuel costs. NASA calls it the Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge project, or ACTE. It's best described in three words: Shape. Shifting. Wings. Those words sound like science fiction, but NASA and a company called Flexsys are developing wings that change shape in response to flight conditions and weather. Superflexible very strong composite materials make it possible. What does that mean to air travelers? You've probably looked out the window of an airliner to see the hinged metal flaps on the rear edge of a wing. New flexible materials allow the wing to change shapes without hinges. NASA shows off new flight technology . This week, NASA invited dozens of aerospace bloggers and social media mavens to see new aviation technology at its Armstrong Flight Research Center in California's High Desert, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. They got an exclusive look at NASA's flexible wing project and other ongoing research aimed at aviation. They also got a chance to hang out with engineers and pilots. Then, they tweeted about it. Project manager Tom Rigney compared the flexible wings to ""watching a bathtub bend. You don't expect something shaped like that to bend into a very fluid looking shape."" If these new wings end up on airliners in the coming decades, they'll transform our flying experience into smoother, more comfortable and less expensive journeys. But don't expect them until ","NASA and Flexsys are developing shape-shifting wings for airplanes .

The ice island, known as iceberg B31, covers 255 square miles and could be almost a third of a mile thick, scientists say in a report from NASA's Earth Observatory. The iceberg calved from Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier last November, according to NASA. The crack that produced it was first spotted in 2011. Since November, B31 has drifted out of Pine Island Bay and into the Amundsen Sea off the western side of the continent. ""The iceberg is now well out of Pine Island Bay and will soon join the more general flow in the Southern Ocean, which could be east or west in this region,"" iceberg researcher Grant Bigg from the University of Sheffield in England said in the NASA statement. Once that happens, the researchers worry it will be difficult track the iceberg during the long weeks of darkness that comprise the Antarctic winter. And don't expect it to melt.

ca25e0574414ed7cf0523cbf7411af7ea4b878d5,"(CNN) -- Verizon pulled a rabbit out of its corporate hat earlier this month. The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway. Verizon purchased these rights from Comcast and Time Warner, two large cable-TV companies, and the smaller Bright House Networks. Sound familiar? AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum. The AT&T deal drew the wrath of the Justice Department and the FCC. Indeed, it appears the current incarnation of the AT&T proposed merger is dying a slow death. U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle agreed on Monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing, and asked AT&T to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with T-Mobile. Does a similar fate await Verizon? Ah, you say, there's no real comparison. Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market. But the deals do have one big thing in common: In both, the primary objective is to cope with the looming scarcity of spectrum. For without more of it, neither carrier will be able to deliver on the promise of whizbang wireless services such as high definition movies any time, anywhere. To be sure, the problem here is not precisely a shortage of spectrum, but wasteful allocation of what's usable with the latest technology. If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses. That includes spectrum warehoused by government: In many cases, the repositioning of equipment or the purchase of up-to-date equipment would allow tasks ranging from public safety communication to weather forecasting to be done as well with less.

Rejlander sold the album of 70 prints to 19th century naval hydrographer Captain George Browing, and it was passed down through the family to most recent owner, who the auctioneers said had no inkling of its significance.

Calm and measured, Kim Jong Un covered a wide range of topics, from foreign policy to the economy, as he spoke during choreographed festivities honoring the 100th birthday of his late grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung. The rocket unveiled on Sunday, which appeared to have several stages, was similar to the one that broke into pieces over the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff Friday, but was of a more overtly military design.

The genome of a prehistoric horse that roamed the plains of Canada almost 800,000 years ago has been unveiled. It is about 10 times older than any DNA ever recovered and comes from a fragment of the ancient animal’s foot that had been so remarkably preserved in permafrost scientists were able to extract blood proteins. Dating up to 780,000 years ago, the bone sheds fresh light on equine evolution and dramatically extends the known limit of DNA survival. Scientists extracted the DNA from two pieces of 700,000-year-old horse bone found in the frozen Yukon . Professor Ludovic Orlando, of Copenhagen University, and colleagues mapped the animal’s genes and compared them to another ancient horse from around 43,000 years ago as well as five contemporary breeds, the only surviving wild horse called a Przewalski and a donkey. State of the art DNA analysis techniques allowed them to sequence 73 proteins, including some found in the blood. The study, published in Nature, showed the Equus lineage that gave rise to all modern-day horses, donkeys and zebras originated around four million years ago - twice the conventionally accepted time. The genome - or complete DNA - is almost 10 times older than the previous record which was for an early human called a Denisovan that lived about 80,000 years ago. It shows horse populations have fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years particularly during times of severe climatic change.

Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website.

But it's possible they got into the market just before the getting stopped being good. There's a rising backlash against ""spam"" search results and other low-quality content, and that could spell the death knell for content farms like Demand. The problem: Google used to be an efficient way to find what you needed. Enter a search term, and, presto, the results served up the very thing you were looking for. But increasingly, that's not the case. Investor and business commentator Paul Kedrosky recently vented his outrage at the pile of garbage he found on Google when he went looking for tips on buying a dishwasher. UC Berkeley professor (and tech commentator) Vivek Wadhwa threw up his hands when Google couldn't help his students find the information they were looking for. And at a panel on the future of search earlier this week, Loopt co-founder Sam Altman said: ""Three times in the last month, I searched for things on Google, and the result wasn't on the front page. That's the first time it's ever happened."" A major source of the problem is the entire industry that has emerged to game the Google system, producing content that looks promising within the results, but that when clicked on, serves up a mishmash of text that looks like sneezed-out alphabet soup. The material produced by Demand Media -- and other content farms, like AOL's Seed -- is usually not as egregious as the example above, but it's often not far behind. Demand and AOL both employ humans, but make thousands of assignments a month -- and there are minimum quality requirements. The payment structure at both companies is such that very few freelancers can afford to devote the time necessary to produce the kind of reliable take a reader might be looking for.

Astronomers have spotted a giant river of hydrogen in space - and say it could be what gives spiral galaxies their ability to keep spewing out stars. They say it could give an unprecedented insight into how galaxies like our own Milky Way form new stars - and why some are far more productive than others. The groundbreaking discovery helps explain the mystery that had baffled astronomers. The bright star-filled central region of galaxy NGC 6946 is shown in blue, while the dense hydrogen tracing out the galaxy's sweeping spiral arms and galactic halo is orange, and the extremely diffuse and extended 'river' of hydrogen engulfing NGC 6946 and its companions is red . The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 . NGC 6946 is located approximately 22 million light-years from Earth on the border of the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus. It is an active galaxy, though less-so than more extreme starburst galaxies, researchers said. 'We knew that the fuel for star formation had to come from somewhere,' said astronomer D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University. 'So far, however, we’ve detected only about 10 percent of what would be necessary to explain what we observe in many galaxies.' 'A leading theory is that rivers of hydrogen – known as cold flows – may be ferrying hydrogen through intergalactic space, clandestinely fueling star formation. But this tenuous hydrogen has been simply too diffuse to detect, until now.' Using the National Science Foundation’s Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University has discovered what could be a never-before-seen river of hydrogen flowing through space. The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946.

Expensive: This garage, in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge, is on the market for £525,000 . But it has just been put on the market with the highest price tag ever charged for a garage by the estate agency WA Ellis, which was founded in 1868. At a record price of £525,000, the buyer could buy three of Britain’s ‘average’ homes, which currently cost £160,000 each, for the same price, and still have £45,000 left over in change. It is possible to swing a cat in the garage, but only just - it measures 6.4 metres wide and just 4.75 metres deep. Robert Lewis, an associate at W A Ellis, insists the garage is ‘exceptionally valuable’ because it is ‘very rare’ for a freehold garage in Knightsbridge to come up for sale. He said: ‘We anticipate interest from those already living within a two or three minute walk of the garage. 'For example, the large houses on Walton Place where there is no off-street parking.’ The garage was put up for sale a week after a  flat-roofed brick shed, in Highgate village, north London, went on the market for £259,950.

The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is ‘going nowhere’. The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant. The Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, which represents 2,000 charities, claims reforms designed to hand power from Whitehall to communities and good causes are moving ‘glacially slow’. Criticism of government reforms comes as Mr Cameron and Deputy PM Nick Clegg today launch a Mid-Term Review of the coalition’s progress and set out new policies for the next two and a half years. Mr Cameron had boasted that the Big Society was his ‘great passion’ but critics said it was vague and was being used as a cover for cuts to public services. Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed. Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded.

A man who served 17 years in prison after police tricked him into falsely confessing to murdering his parents has settled a wrongful conviction lawsuit against New York state for nearly $3.4million. Martin Tankleff, 42, was convicted in the 1988 killings of his parents in their eastern Long Island home. But he was freed in 2007 after an appeals court found key evidence in his trial was overlooked. Prosecutors ultimately decided against a new trial. His attorneys argued that his confession was coerced and that a family business associate was the real culprit. A spokeswoman for the state attorney general confirmed the settlement, saying it resolves the case on behalf of the state. Tankleff was 17 years old when his parents were bludgeoned and stabbed. He told police he found them on September 7, 1988, in their waterfront home in Belle Terre. His mother was dead; his father was gravely wounded and died a few weeks later. The teenager suggested that a partner in his father's bagel business could be the killer. He said the partner owed Seymour Tankleff hundreds of thousands of dollars. The business partner, Jerry Steuerman, was never charged and has denied involvement in the crimes. After questioning Tankleff at home and at police headquarters, detectives falsely told him that his father had awoken from a coma and named him as the killer. At that point, Tankleff wondered aloud whether he might have 'blacked out' and committed the crimes. Police said they read him his Miranda warning, but Tankleff waived his rights and confessed to attacking his parents.

The former top-ranked player announced on Monday that he will be staying with his longtime agent Mark Steinberg, who has left IMG after his contract expired. ""Staying with Mark Steinberg. Total confidence in him,"" Woods wrote on social networking website Twitter. ""Excited about the next stage in my professional life. Fond memories of Mark McCormack."" McCormack founded IMG, one of the world's leading sports management companies, but died in 2003. Sliding Tiger drops out of golf's top ten . Woods' endorsements have been handled by Steinberg since 1998, but the golfer's declining fortunes have reportedly led to his agent's departure from IMG. Woods has not won a tournament since the end of 2009, and the scandal about his marital infidelities that broke after that resulted in the loss of some lucrative sponsorship deals. The 35-year-old has dropped to 15th in the rankings, struggling this year with injuries, but he still earned $70 million in 2010 from his existing deals according to Golf Digest. Harmon expresses fears for Woods' career . Sports Business Journal and the New York Times both reported that Woods' reduced earnings meant that IMG could no longer afford Steinberg's salary. IMG has instead promoted Guy Kinnings and Robbie Henchman, its senior vice-presidents in Europe and Asia Pacific respectively, to be co-heads of its golf division.

Many parents actually agree with singer Myleene Klass, who last week said she felt under pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' presents for other people's children . The findings suggest that many parents share the negative view of Myleene about being asked to donate money towards a class collection for birthday gifts. One in eight of those polled said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, and of these, the majority (53 per cent) thought the request had been cheeky and that the child should be happy with what they received. Only a quarter of those questioned  (28 per cent) said they were happy to contribute to a group present if it meant the youngster got what they wanted. In terms of cost, more than a third were asked to contribute less than £10, while a further 42 per cent could choose how much to give.

Temptress: Three women wearing 'sexy' police outfits and sexy lingerie (pictured) tricked the wardens into letting them in by promising them an orgy . They arrived at around 3am on Thursday morning and asked if they could come inside to 'chat and drink', police say. The prison guards obliged and were soon persuaded to leave their posts, before heading to the sleeping quarters with the scantily clad women. After drugging and handcuffing the wardens, they took their keys and unlocked all the prison's cells according to police chief Angelina de Andrades Ferreira. She told a news conference: 'The plan was to seduce them. They served them cheap whisky with some substance to knock them out, then unlocked the central gate which accesses the internal cells. 'Whoever wanted to escape left by the front door. From the moment they drank the whisky the agents don't remember a thing. 'One was found dizzy, trying to wake up. Another slept for the whole afternoon and couldn't even be questioned.' Dozens of prisoners walked straight out the main door carrying guns and ammunition they took from the prison caches. The inmates took three 12-calibre rifles, shotguns, two 38-calibre revolvers and munition, she said. Police later discovered a bag of lingerie and skimpy leather police uniforms which they believe the temptresses wore to distract the wardens. Blame: The prison guards will now be charged with 'facilitating a jailbreak' and 'culpable embezzlement' because some prisoners walked out with weapons from the prison cache .

A New York Times bestselling author, Moyo first grabbed international headlines with her 2009 book ""Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa."" Since then, she's penned two more books, on the subject of the decline of the West, and the effects of China's commodities rush. In a new interview with CNN's Robyn Curnow, Moyo explains why she's optimistic about the future of Africa. She looks at the positive impact that China can have on the continent and details the key drivers that will spur Africa's economic growth. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: The aid debate is so different from before ... Dambisa Moyo: So much has happened in the last five years -- whether you're in Africa, South America or Asia, nobody talks about aid anymore. Policy makers themselves are going out and issuing debts in the market. My own country, Zambia, did a fantastic bond, a $750 million 10-year bond, last September. The discussion is so much more about job creation and investment, which is such a fantastic story and it's obviously partly to do with the fact that the traditional donors are having a financial problem, fiscal problem, on their balance sheets. They just don't have the capital anymore to hand out cash like they did in the past. CNN: The Chinese story has been thrown into the mix, has that changed the landscape? DM: Yes, absolutely, but in a strange way it's exactly what we need in terms of delivering economic growth and meaningfully reducing poverty. We need jobs, we need investment, we need trade, we need foreign direct investment, whether investment domestically but also from the outside. It's not some magic pill, everybody knows that this is the formula, and finally the Chinese are showing up, again, not just in Africa, bu","Dambisa Moyo is a Zambian economist, investment strategist and author .

Manchester United's patience with manager David Moyes is being driven by an increasing belief that he was handed a questionable behind-the-scenes legacy by his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. One club source said post-Ferguson, ‘it was like looking behind the curtain of the Wizard of Oz and seeing there was nothing there to work with’. United fans have grown increasingly disillusioned with Moyes in recent days as a disappointing season got a lot worse with 3-0 home defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City.

The United board and in particular the owners the Glazer family will only stand so many dreadful  performances on the field and next week’s daunting Champions League tie against Bayern Munich may prove decisive in terms of Moyes’s future. However, Sportsmail understands that one reason why chief executive Ed Woodward and fellow board members are giving Moyes so much time and patience is that they feel he inherited a set-up from Ferguson that was not fit for purpose at Barclays Premier League level. Nobody at the club wants publicly to sully Ferguson’s legacy, given that his 27-year reign lifted United from oblivion to the summit of European football. He also left Moyes a squad that had just won the league by 11 points. But it has since emerged that he ran United’s football operation in such a closed-off way that the board believe the task of restructuring required to bring it up to speed with the rest of Europe’s top clubs is much harder than expected.

About 34 million people are infected with HIV and although drugs are used to manage many cases, there is currently no vaccine that can prevent new infections . This is because of the challenges posed by the ‘envelope’ protein, which is called Env. Env’s structure is so complex and delicate scientists have found it difficult to get the protein into a form that is suitable for the imaging technique necessary to study it. Professor Andrew Ward, of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), explained: ‘It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it’s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable.’ In the study, researchers created a version of Env that has the stability and other properties needed for successful imaging, but that retains virtually all the structures found on Env.

Those figures were first noted in a report by The International Business Times. Sheltered? Microsoft has said it keeps $92.9billion overseas . 'The amount of money that Microsoft is keeping offshore represents a significant spike from prior years, and the levies the company would owe amount to almost the entire two-year operating budget of the company’s home state of Washington,' the website reported. In June, a Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ) report indicated that Microsoft heavily relies on tax shelters.

The Portuguese striker grabbed both goals as Real won 2-1 at Celta Vigo which takes his record for the club to 188 goals in 186 games. Jose Mourinho's side have now won six games in a row, including twice against Barcelona and a decisive victory against Manchester United to take them into the last eight of the European Champions League. Despite their victory Real still sit 13 points behind runaway leaders Barca, and have their sights set on a cup double -- in Europe's top club competition and Spain's most prestigious cup tournament, the Copa del Rey. Real went close twice in the first half through France forward Karim Benzema, both chances supplied by Ronaldo, but he turned finisher on the hour mark when he turned and finished from close range after a deflection in the area. But Celta, who are deep in relegation trouble, pulled level just two minutes later when Iago Aspas' shot took a deflection off Portuguese defender Pepe and squirmed past Diego Lopez. Real restored their advantage when Celta goalkeeper Javi Varas brought down Brazil playmaker Kaka and Ronaldo stepped up to score his 25th league goal of the season -- 15 behind Messi's league tally. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain missed a glorious chance to put the game beyond doubt when he somehow contrived to miss from six yards out after a perfect center from Germany international Mesut Ozil. And Real were nearly made to pay as Celta's on loan Arsenal forward Park Chu-Young, from South Korea, headed against the crossbar late in the game. Real's win moved them into second place after city rivals Atletico Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat by Real Sociedad. Xabi Prieto scored the only goal of the game as Atletico sank to third, one point behind Real. Elsewhere, Iker Mu","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 2-1 in La Liga .

Unlike the public debacle that ensued following the Cartagena incident, this 2010 occurrence did not lead to any thorough investigation and the agent in question had their proposed sanctions withdrawn. 'Individuals consumed alcohol; interacted with (female foreign nationals); and were untruthful when initially questioned by managers,' the report reads according to The Washington Post. In addition to brushing past the Cartagena, Colombia scandal that occurred in May 2012, the 18-month investigation also found that there were a handful of reports of agents soliciting prostitutes including one as recent as this year. Again details were scant in the report, but the agent who 'engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money' earlier this year had his security credentials report.

After three years in retirement, Schumacher returned to F1 with the new Mercedes team, but has struggled to make an impact on the race track, finishing this year's season in a disappointing ninth place. It has led many to wonder why the racing legend has returned to sport. But amid the gossip and allegations, the 41-year-old has defended his decision. He told CNN: ""I enjoy it. I feel I have the right to do what I enjoy. Whether I put in dispute my reputation...I just feel good about my decision and I have so much support from people.""

3c3525cd549626cab6bd9c33c1c32050631d1b8e,"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called a high-level judiciary meeting to discuss the case of a rape victim who was jailed because of the attack and has agreed to marry the rapist to get out of prison and legitimize her daughter, the president's spokesman said Monday. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday in Kabul, was called in reaction to a petition with nearly 5,000 signatures and media inquiries about the case, said Karzai spokesman Aimal Faizi. The woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she approached authorities to report that her cousin's husband had raped her two years ago. CNN is identifying her only as Gulnaz to protect her identity. She did not immediately report the attack, fearing reprisals from elements of Afghanistan's conservative society and was sentenced to prison for adultery because her attacker was married at the time. Her sentence was later reduced to three years. A spokesman for the attorney general, Rahmatullah Naziri, told CNN last week that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced, she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense. She is now raising her daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter. She also fears attack from her rapist's relatives, something he denies is a risk. Kim Motley, a lawyer for 21-year-old Gulnaz, said the petition gathered 4,751 names in about 48 hours. The palace received the petition on Sunday, she said. It comes with an official plea for clemency addressed to the president, who has the power to immediately pardon Gulnaz. Her plight gained international attention when the European Union blocked the broadcast of a documentary made about her ordeal saying that it would further jeopardize her safety. The U.S. State Department, while not explicitly calling for Gulnaz's release, said Thursday that ""Gulnaz's situation is one no woman should have to face"" and called on ","Afghanistan's president calls high-level judiciary meeting to discuss rape victim's case .

According to a report in the English-language China Daily, the laser can hit drones travelling below 1,600 feet at a speed of up to 110mph. China's Xinhau News Agency reported the new weapon system could be mounted to vehicles and deployed to protect major public events. Yi Jinsong, who is involved with developing the project said: 'Intercepting such drones is usually the work of snipers and helicopters, but their success rate is not as high and mistakes with accuracy can result in unwanted damage.' The United States has developed its own laser technology, with a prototype weapon fitted to a naval vessel to target drones and small aircraft. According to Chinese officials, their new system can shoot down a rogue drone within five seconds of detecting its target. The reported development comes as concerns about the country's military preparedness are being raised in state media.

Simple measures such as staying at home during a flu pandemic can help halt spread of the virus, scientists have today revealed . A new study by a team of scientists at the University of California, Arizona State University, Georgia State University and Yale University found these non-pharmaceutical interventions can prove effective. Whether privately initiated or policy directed, actions calling for the closure of schools and entertainment venues, and cancelling public events are becoming more relevant in control strategies. Lead author of the study economist Michael Springborn, from the Univeristy of California, said: The swine flu outbreak that hit Mexico City in April 2009 could have been worse, but spread of the virus was reduced by people's behavioural response of distancing themselves from each other.' The researchers created a a new model that incorporates behavioural responses into existing models of disease spread. In April 2009 in Mexico, following confirmation of a new strain of A/H1N1 influenza virus, or swine flu, the federal government closed public schools in Mexico City and 'social distancing' measures were put in place. Researchers looked at television viewing in the home in Central Mexico as an indicator of behavioural response, during the pandemic. Professor Springborn said television ratings are consistently and widely available and 'highly correlate' with time spent in the home.

The luggage, belonging to an Iranian citizen, contained 18 metal objects packed in individual steel cases, Russia's Federal Customs Service said. The agency said the material, the radioactive isotope Sodium-22, can be obtained in a nuclear reactor. The news sparked concern that the incident may have been related to Iran's nuclear program, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last month could be geared to produce weapons. Iran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Nuclear expert Michael Friedlander said Sodium-22 has no applications related to weapons. It is generally used to calibrate nuclear instruments in medical equipment, he said. Initial tests showed that radiation levels of the objects were 20 times above normal, the Russian customs service said. Radiation expert Paddy Regan, a professor at England's University of Surrey, said the material was unlikely to present a major hazard. He said Sodium-22 can be made in medical accelerators and is usually not produced in reactors. It is also not used in reactors as a component of fuel, he said. The customs agency said the objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport. A criminal investigation is under way. No details were available on the identity of the Iranian passenger, who apparently flew to Tehran on the flight.

Right: Sperm donors have been handed the right to play a part in the lives of their biological children following a landmark High Court decision . Sperm donors were handed the right to see and play a part in the lives of their biological children in a landmark High Court case yesterday. They may now also win the right to regular contact with the children, even though they are not bringing them up. The ruling by the Family Division decreed that a sperm donor need never have had a sexual relationship with a mother in order to have a say in the child’s upbringing. The judgement came in a complex dispute over parental rights between three gay and lesbian civil partner couples. This case involved a donor who had previously known the mother of the children. However, the ruling leaves open the prospect that unprecedented rights for involvement in the lives of children may be granted to sperm donors who have little or no connection to the mothers. The case threw fresh light on the agonising dilemmas that can be faced by the growing numbers of gay families. Until now the law – set down five years ago in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act – has refused contact for sperm donors who have no other legal or domestic relationship with their biological children. The case was brought by a gay sperm donor whose child is being brought up by a lesbian couple. The Family Division ruling applies because the 2008 Act extended the law governing the rights of sperm donors to cover same sex couples. The biological father and his civil partner were friends with two lesbian couples, both also in civil partnerships. He is the father of two children of one of the lesbian couples. His civil partner is the biological father of a child being brought up by the other lesbian couple.

Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled ""The Book"" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, ""We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort."" The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.","Oil painting said to be the only portrait for which Michael Jackson sat .

The majority report issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the George W. Bush administration deployed in the fear-laden days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The techniques, according to the report, were ""deeply flawed,"" poorly managed and often resulted in ""fabricated"" information. The report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated Washington a decade ago. Democrats argue the tactics conflict with American values while leading members of the Bush administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack. The CIA immediately hit back at the report, saying in a statement that the program was ""effective"" and substantially helped its understanding of al Qaeda's tactical operations and goals. But President Barack Obama said the report reinforced his view that the harsh interrogation methods ""were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests."" In its most graphic details, an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the CIA has previously admitted. It finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation ""in near nonstop fashion for days or weeks at a time."" ""In many cases, the most aggressive techniques were used immediately, in combination and nonstop,"" the report says.

""Happy New Year,"" Biden, who became the Democratic point man in the talks, told reporters. ""Did you think we would be here New Year's Eve?"" A senior Democratic aide told CNN that if caucus meetings went well, a Senate vote could come ""within the hour."" But the House of Representatives went home long before midnight, meaning nothing will get through Congress before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in, at least on paper. A source familiar with the deal told CNN that the Senate proposal would put off the cuts for two months and keep the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for individuals earning less than $400,000 or couples earning less than $450,000. President Barack Obama has long demanded that the threshold be set at $250,000. Tax rates on income above those levels would go back to the Clinton-era rate of 39.6%, up from the current 35%, and itemized deductions would be capped at $250,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples. That would generate an estimated $600 billion in additional revenue over 10 years. Taxes on inherited estates will go up to 40% from 35%, but the exemption will be indexed to rise with inflation -- a provision the source said was added at the insistence of moderate Democrats. Unemployment insurance would be extended for a year for for 2 million people, and the alternative minimum tax -- a perennial issue -- would be permanently adjusted for inflation. Child care, tuition and research and development tax credits would be renewed. And the ""Doc Fix"" -- reimbursements for doctors who take Medicare patients -- will continue, but it won't be paid for out of the Obama administration's signature health care law.

Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often to quick for the brain to fully digest. New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's ""moral compass"" to process and could harm young people's emotional development. Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update, according to a University of Southern California study. ""If things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality,"" said researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. The report, published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. iReport.com: Growing pains for Twitter, Facebook? Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration of compassion.

A colony of sea lions who have resided on the wooded decks of Pier 39 for more than 20 have made a sudden exit, just as they made an expected arrival in October 1989. Shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake hit San Francisco, the sea lions began taking up residence at the pier and forming an urban colony. Scroll down for video . The pier was this week abandoned by the barking mammals who are thought to have gone south to breed . The decks of San Francisco's Pier 39, seen here in 2012, were once home to hundreds of sea lions . Previously, sea lions barely had enough room to stretch out on the wood pier decks during peak times . By January the following year they had taken over the area, much to the displeasure of marina tenants, and there was soon more than 300 of them lounging about and barking. The pier soon became a tourist attraction and by November 2009, the colony reached an all-time high of 1,701. This week the decks, once full of the blubbery sun bathers, were empty with tourists left to look out over rows of empty wooden decks. It is thought the sea lions may have headed south to breed, as this isn't the first time the colony has disappeared on mass. Tourists look out over the empty wooden decks of Pier 39 where not a single sea lion can be seen . Scientists believe the sea lions went south to breed . In 2009 their numbers rose to more than 1,500, but a month later only 10 remained. At the time experts said the length of their stay, rather than their exit, was surprising.

In a somber ceremony, bagpipers played ""Amazing Grace"" as coffins were carried from the plane and wreaths laid upon them. Several people were helped down a flight of stairs from the plane; one man's hand and arm were bandaged. Chief Secretary Henry Tang received the arrivals and then told reporters his government would urge its Philippine counterpart to conduct an ""comprehensive, thorough, and impartial"" investigation. ""The truth is the best consolation for the victims and their families,"" he said. He added that Hong Kong is prepared to aid the Philippine authorities during the investigation.

88b490711173825cd9cbf4127063f455057bdd12,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria is second only to South Africa as the country with the highest number of HIV/AIDS sufferers; one would have thought a better gift for the New Year from the government to its people would be to urge the national legislature to pass the anti HIV-discrimination bill that has been with them for a while. But alas, what the people received was a bill that further exposes them to violence and discrimination. While the signing of the bill has generated much reaction on both sides, most of its supporters have based their arguments on religion and African values, forgetting that what binds the nation together is not the divergence of religions but the respect for humanity that is enshrined in the 1999 constitution. What the same-sex marriage (prohibition) bill in fact does is negate the principle of fundamental human rights of association, expression and dignity. When a law does this, it runs the risk of breeding anarchy, an experience that people who are or are merely perceived to be gay know all too much about in the form of blackmail, extortion and fear of arrest. The law also acts against the principle of public health. With rates of HIV infection and AIDS running at 3.7% for the general population, and 17.2% among gay men, criminalizing organizations providing intervention for this population puts all Nigerians in jeopardy. Another thing to note is about the public perception of the law: while many perceive there's casual acceptance by many Nigerians of the bill, in fact many of those who have commented on the bill have not even read it. Aside from the fact that sections of this law are in direct violation of our fundamental human rights -- freedom of expression and assembly, freedom to have a private and family life -- and set back the provision of healthcare services, they effectively signify that it is open season to attack the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and mainstream society in general.

Tyler Weinman, 18, was fitted with an ankle bracelet for electronic monitoring and escorted home by Miami-Dade Police. He also has been charged with improper disposal of dead animals and burglary in the monthlong cat killing spree. Judge John Thornton ordered Weinman released after a court-appointed psychologist found the teen was mentally competent and not a danger to himself or others. Weinman, who had been on suicide watch, flashed a quick smile to photographers and reporters as he entered the courtroom. He made no statements at the hearing. ""He's an innocent man.

Norman Schwarzkopf, who led allied forces to a routing of Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and became one of the nation's most celebrated military heroes of the era, died Thursday, a U.S. defense official said. He was 78. The death of the retired four-star Army general was confirmed by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who described Schwarzkopf as ""one of the great military giants of the 20th century."" President Barack Obama called the death of Schwarzkopf a loss of an ""American original."" ""From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, General Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved,"" Obama said. ""Our prayers are with the Schwarzkopf family, who tonight can know that his legacy will endure in a nation that is more secure because of his patriotic service."" Virtually unknown to the public before the Persian Gulf War, Schwarzkopf became a household name while he oversaw the buildup of 700,000 coalition troops, including more than 540,000 U.S. forces, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The war began on January 17, 1991, with the start of the nearly six-week air campaign against Iraq that was followed by a 100-hour ground offensive that pushed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait. A Time magazine correspondent described the general, as he prepared his troops along the Kuwaiti border, as a man ""with a John Wayne swagger and a growl like a grizzly."" Schwarzkopf, dubbed ""Stormin' Norman"" by his troops because of his reported temper, captured the public's imagination with his plain, frank talk about the war's progress. He once told a room full of reporters: ""As far as Saddam Hussein being a great military strategist, he is neither a strategist, nor is he schooled in the operational arts, nor is he a tactician, nor is he a general, nor is he a soldier. Other than that, he's a great military man, I want you to know that."" Former Secretary of Sta","NEW: Colin Powell says Schwarzkopf's leadership inspired a nation .

The statement, delivered by one of AQAP's top clerics --  Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari -- is a significant setback to ISIS efforts to assume leadership of the global jihadist movement a week after groups in Egypt and Libya joined the ISIS fold. ISIS and al Qaeda's top leadership in Pakistan had a bitter falling out earlier this year, and al Qaeda and ISIS fighters have been fighting each other in Syria, but AQAP had until now stayed above the fray, calling for both sides to reconcile and pool resources to strike the United States. But when al-Baghdadi declared  in an audiotape released last week his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen, as well as other Middle Eastern countries, it was too much for the AQAP leadership to stomach. By claiming Yemen for his caliphate, al-Baghdadi had called into question the very right of AQAP to exist as a separate and autonomous jihadi group, leaving its leadership no choice but to push back. ""We did not want to talk about the current dispute and the sedition in Syria... however, our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate [and] they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries which they have have no governance, and considered them to be provinces that belonged to them,"" al-Nadhari stated, according to a translation by the SITE intelligence group. ""The announcement of the caliphate for all Muslims by our brothers in the Islamic State did not meet the required conditions,"" al-Nashari argued, because other jihadi groups were not consulted. The cleric also criticized ISIS for ""going too far in interpretations in terms of spilling inviolable blood under the excuse of expanding and spreading the power of the Islamic State.""

The victims' houses were also burned down. A note, apparently written in the form of a ""haiku"" poem -- a typically short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home next door to one of the burned out homes. Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a ""suspicious"" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN. The following morning, two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims' respective homes. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. Despite feverish media speculation, Harada refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings, though he said the man, who's been missing since Sunday, could provide valuable information about what happened. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: ""Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows."" Mitake is a remote, mountainous hamlet with only 16 inhabitants. According to local media, the man police are hunting lived alone and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents. Reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7-8 years ago. One of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper.","Five bodies discovered in remote village in Western Japan; their house burned down .

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the five airports cover the destinations of 94 percent of the people who travel to the U.S. from the three heavily hit countries in West Africa – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It has been just ten days since a Liberian man was rushed to a Dallas, Texas hospital with the first case of Ebola diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters Wednesday that 'as long as Ebola continues to spread in Africa, we can't make the risk zero here.'

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday it flew an employee back to the United States from West Africa by chartered plane after the staff member came in contact with an international healthcare worker who later tested positive for Ebola. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said the employee was 'feeling fine' and had been scheduled to return to the United States from West Africa anyway. The staffer's exposure was 'low-risk', the CDC said in a statement. According to the statement, the staff member worked in 'close proximity', which it defined as within three feet, and in the same room with the ill person for a prolonged period during the period that that individual had symptoms.

The Gran America emporium in Paraguay tempted clients with savings of up to 80 per cent - but only if they took their clothes off. The store, which sells clothes, perfumes and electrical products, made a normal month’s takings in just a few hours as over 100 men and women stripped off to shop. Naked ambition: The Paraguayan store offered a huge discount as long as customers turned up in underwear, similar to this promotion in Spain alst year . As a result the promotion, which was expected to last an hour, was extended for the whole of the day on Saturday. Henry Martins, sales manager of the shop in Cuidad del Este on the border with Brazil, told Paraguay’s Vanguardia newspaper that sales had plummeted after Brazil recently tightened customs controls. He said: 'It was either come up with something creative or go bust. At first we wanted people to go completely naked but realised I could have got into trouble with the law. 'It was a great success. We had people in their underwear taking advantage of the promotion, and lots more coming in to get an eyeful. 'I’ve never seen the shop so full. We’re already planning our next one.'

The Kremlin's proposed game of musical chairs is the kind of change whose only purpose is to keep things as they are. Putin and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when Medvedev's presidential term expires. The only question was in what configuration the two leaders would return. To stay in the same positions would have smacked of stagnation. Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat. It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights. Some will predict a tightening of authoritarian rule. Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much. For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so. Those who imagine that a second Medvedev term would have produced dramatic breakthroughs face the problem of explaining why his first term did not. Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the ""reset"" of recent years. Improved relations with the US could not have been pursued had Putin not approved of the policy. Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team.

The badly burnt body of 38-year-old Oliver Gobat was found on the idyllic Caribbean island in April. He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned. The family of murdered Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death . However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island. Mr Gobat’s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: ‘We’re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action. ‘Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.’ The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty. The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently. Oliver Gobat, 38, was shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover (pictured) Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have launched a private investigation into the suspected contract killing.

Victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili is set to become the next prime minister. Saakashvili will remain president until presidential elections next year. The result of Monday's election means Georgia will have a multi-party parliament, boosting democracy in the nation, observers said. The vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about Saakashvili. He took power in 2004 after the Rose Revolution, the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections. Saakashvili is credited with having changed the country by moving toward integration with the West, with steps such as seeking membership in the European Union and NATO. He also revamped the nation's economy, retooling it to reflect a free market system. But critics said that beneath the surface, his government was dominated by Soviet-style ""administrative measures."" Ivanishvili, whose Georgian Dream alliance won a majority of seats in the 150-member parliament, said the new government would seek to mend the country's troubled relations with Russia. The two nations fought a brief but bitter war four years ago over the breakaway region of South Ossetia. ""Restoring relations with the Kremlin is one of our main tasks and we will strive in every way to do this,"" he told CNN. ""I think it's achievable but not easy. First we have to convince the Kremlin that our strategy toward NATO and Europe is not harmful to and does not contradict Russian interests."" NATO ambitions .

Though Koh Rong remains surprisingly undeveloped, at least by Thai island standards, its business owners are notoriously party-friendly, bringing in generators to keep the music going until the wee hours and offering live DJs and free-beer happy hours. A 24-hour bar and a permissive attitude towards ganja have made the island a go-to spot for sun burnt travelers who want to bake on the beach by day and get toasted by night. Getting there: High-speed ferries run from Sihanoukville (Speed Ferry Cambodia, Serendipity Beach Road, Sihanoukville, +855 34 934 744), which takes 50 minutes from shore and costs $15 return.

The new health and safety ruling has been drawn up Bacton parish council because of fears that members of the public could be hit and injured by stray balls. Bowled out: Club members, left to right, Scott Cain, Kurtis Gale, 18, Ramone Stringer and Josh Cain, 13 . But club officials have refused to agree to the new set of rules, governing the use of the Cubitt Memorial Playing Field in Bacton. Club chairman David Gale said talks were now in place to move the team away from the village to a new base at nearby North Walsham High School. He said: 'We are a cricket team - how are we supposed to practice without cricket balls? Are they expecting us to use tennis balls instead? 'It's upsetting - I've spent 10 summers nurturing the cricket square and you can really bat on it. The rules are untenable.' Mr Gale said it was common for batsmen and bowlers at any club to practise outside of the nets, adding that the nets at the ground were of a poor quality.

Nearly 92% of Congress -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as Christian, according to a study by Pew Research's Religion & Public Life Project. That number is slightly up from 90% in the 113th Congress and continues a trend where the percentage of Christians and Jews in Congress outpaces their national average. Though Christians dominate both parties, Democrats are more religiously diverse than Republicans. Of the 301 Republicans in the 114th Congress, Jewish freshman Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is the only non-Christian. A large majority of Democrats in Congress (80%) are Christian, with 44% Protestant, 35% Catholic and 1% Mormon. But unlike Republicans, Democrats in Congress are 12% Jewish and have two Buddhist, two Muslims, one Hindu and one unaffiliated member. ""You could say that the religious diversity in Congress is concentrated on the Democratic side,"" said Alan Cooperman, director of religious research at Pew. ""The vast majority of the Jews, all of the Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus in Congress and the one unaffiliated member are all on the Democratic side."" Congress, the most representative and responsive branch of the federal government, has seen some aspects of their religious affiliation mirror nationwide trends.

Today, that number has roughly tripled to 6%. What's more, there has been a noticeable decline in Protestants that mirrors nationwide trends. In 1961, 75% of Congress and roughly 2/two-thirds of the country identified as Protestant. Fifty-seven percent of the 114th Congress is Protestant, while 49% of the country identifies as such today.

30856323596de44303fc864b711d734081acdad2,"(CNN) -- Up to 30 million people are facing ""a humanitarian disaster"" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday. Porters remove goods from a boat on Lake Chad in 2007. Lake Chad was about the size of Maryland -- bigger than Israel or Kuwait -- in 1963, satellite images show. By 2001, it covered less than one-fifth of that area -- making it smaller than Delaware or Mauritius. The drying-up of the shallow lake is fueling conflict and migration, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said. Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ""If that happens it's going to be a disaster,"" Parviz Koohafkan, director of the Land and Water Division of the FAO, told CNN by phone from Rome. The Lake Chad basin is ""one of the most important agriculture heritage sites in the world -- the biodiversity, the migratory birds, not to mention more than 20 million people living out of Lake Chad -- fisherpeople, farmers."" ""It would be a human disaster, a tragedy,"" he said. ""In this case we have people who are the poorest of the poor."" ""In addition to an approximately 60 percent decline in fish production, there has been degradation of pasturelands, leading to a shortage of animal feed estimated at 45 percent in certain places in 2006, reduction in livestock and biodiversity,"" the agency said. The disappearance of the lake is being caused by climate change, population pressure and natural variations in climate, the FAO said. Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said. The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, ""Saving Lake Chad,"" in Rome, Italy, on Friday.

7e1885ac1bb267aa8ac3d3828e9607e278f75527,"(CNN) -- Massive global greenhouse gas pollution is changing the chemistry of the world's oceans so much that scientists now predict it could severely damage shellfish populations and the nations that depend on the harvests if significant action isn't taken. A new study from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts shows that ocean acidification is becoming a very serious problem. The study was published in July online in the journal Fish and Fisheries. ""What the study found was that in the next 10 to 50 years many countries are going to see impacts, particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels, and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods,"" said Jackie Savitz, senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization Oceana. Ocean acidification, or the changing chemical make-up of seawater, has occurred since the industrial revolution as ocean waters absorbed too much carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of human industrial activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. The Woods Hole study found that many marine animals like mollusks and corals that build hard shells and skeletons are most at risk from this. Those countries directly impacted are mostly poor and developing nations that are heavily dependent on shellfish as main sources for protein, like Senegal, Madagascar and Haiti. But the research also suggests damage caused by ocean acidification could ripple across economies around the world. It's already blamed for economic losses at oyster farms in the Pacific Northwest and the slowing of coral growth in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, according to Oceana. ""The truth is, if you look at all the effects of ocean acidification, nobody really gets off the hook,"" Savitz told CNN Radio. ""Impacts on coral reefs, for example, that can affect tourism, that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs. And when yo","Woods Hole research says poor nations would suffer first .

But this time it's not the geopolitical arena where the action takes place -- but the glitzy stage of the Eurovision Song Contest. Both countries have made it through the semi-finals to compete in the grand final in Copenhagen, Denmark. The usual artistic rivalry has been given an added piquancy by the tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in March and eastern Ukraine is currently roiled by pro-Russian separatist protests. The organizers describe Eurovision -- widely loved for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as a non-political event meant to unite Europe through song. But in reality, politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances. This was demonstrated to an unusual degree on Tuesday, when Russia's entrants -- 17-year-old twins Anastasia and Maria Tolmachevy -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, told CNN that the contest is about national identity as well as music. ""Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,"" Adams said. ""The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities."" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion. It goes, ""...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time ... maybe there's a day you'll be mine.""

The exquisitely preserved brain was found in a fossil of the creature that lived in the Lower Cambrian, around 520 million years ago. The discovery reveals a brain that is surprisingly simple and less complex than those known from fossils of some of the animal’s prey.

On the left here can be seen neural structures in the head of the animal, including the brain. On the right is the fossil, a nearly complete specimen of the ancient predator . The find for the first time identifies the fossilised brain of what are considered the top predators of their time, a group of animals known as anomalocaridids, which translates to 'abnormal shrimp.' The fossil of the world's earliest predator, named Lyrarapax, was found in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan. It is what is known as an anomalocaridid, which translates as an 'abnormal shrimp'. Just over five inches (13 centimetres) long, Lyrarapax was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids, which reached more than three feet (one metre) in length. Paleontologists excavating lower Cambrian rocks in southern Australia found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes, up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye, meaning they were probably highly efficient hunters. Long extinct, these fierce-looking arthropods were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s. They still have scientists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life. ‘Our discovery helps to clarify this debate,’ said Professor Nicholas Strausfeld, director of the University of Arizona's Center for Insect Science and senior author of the paper about the findings. ‘It turns out the top predator of the Cambrian had a","A fossilised brain found near Kunming in China has been identified .

""It never looks good ... It's a pain."" Hamm says he's always worn his hair long, but had to cut it for AMC's TV series, in which he plays a 1960s Madison Avenue ad executive. He says stylists on the show, armed with hair spray and blow dryers, mold his coiffure into a hard shell. Helmet hair has come in handy at work. ""I've had a piece of the set fall on my head and my hair didn't move,"" he said. ""I had seven stitches in my head and my hair didn't move. That's impressive.""

a341ac213e2a0899c7c75c2fa7b3d52ccfc54572,"(CNN) -- The Italian navy rescued 730 migrants from overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily, it said Wednesday. The migrants, who departed in two boats from North Africa, are being taken to a port in Sicily's Agrigento province, the navy said in a statement. Those rescued include 124 women and 29 children, it said. The overcrowded boats were losing buoyancy and the migrants were not equipped with life jackets, the navy added. Italy is a major gateway into Europe for migrants who come by sea from North Africa in hope of reaching EU soil. Shipwrecks off the shores of its Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Lampedusa are common, thanks to the frequent use of overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. But despite the dangers, migrants keep coming. Some of the migrants are from African nations, particularly Eritrea and Somalia, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. According to the European border agency Frontex, more than 12,000 illegal migrants were detected off Sicily and 8,000 off Lampedusa in the third quarter of last year. Many of those arriving on Italy's shores have set sail from Libya, the agency said. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa last October shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. International organizations such as the U.N. refugee agency have called on European and other leaders to try to address the root causes of migration and to create legal alternatives to dangerous sea crossings.

And with Cellino bankrolling the Yorkshire club to the tune of £40million, there would be a danger of Leeds going out of business if the Italian is forced out. The League’s board, who met this week, have lost patience with the Cellino camp over the long delay in receiving the written reasons why Cellino was found guilty by a Sardinian court of evading import tax duty on his yacht. Leeds owner Massimo Cellino could be set to face a misconduct charge by the Football League . The view of the FL directors that is Cellino and his representatives are involved in withholding the six-page judgement by Sardinian judge Dr Sandra Lepore that has reportedly been available for over two months. The next step will be to charge Leeds with misconduct if they don’t receive it. Dr Lepore’s findings are reported to say Cellino acted with ‘elusive intent’ in evading the £305,000 duty when his boat The Nelie moored in Cagliari. And that would be enough to deem Cellino to have acted dishonestly, and so fail the League’s owners and directors test. Cellino in the stands with Leeds fans at Brentford's Griffin Park in September . It is understood neither Cellino nor his London lawyers Mishcon de Reya have a copy of the judge’s report. However Cellino’s Italian legal representative Prof Giovanni Cocco has possession of the document. But Cocco has no intention of handing it over to the Football League, who he believes influenced the judgement, and has further complicated matters by lodging an appeal against Lepore’s findings. Meanwhile, fellow crisis club Fulham have had a bid rejected to take Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, 42, back on loan.","Massimo Cellino could soon face a misconduct charge .

For the first time Hong Kong has muscled its way to top place in the rankings of the world's leading financial systems and capital markets, overtaking the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. slipped to second place although its overall score was unchanged from last year. The UK fell to third place due to lower scores on securitisation and initial public offering (IPO) activity, the Financial Development Report said. The report, launched in 2008, analyses financial development including the efficiency and size of banking and other financial services, the business environment, financial stability, and the extent of financial disclosure and market liberalisation in each centre. Hong Kong, which jumped from fourth place last year, has capitalised on a regulatory crackdown on the finance sector in the U.S. and Europe and on its proximity to China to lure more financial services to its shores. 'Hong Kong's ascent to the top of our index marks a major milestone, the first time in the report's history that the United Kingdom or the U.S. didn't come out on top,' said Kevin Steinberg, chief operating officer of the WEF USA.

A Missouri police officer was arraigned Friday after a grand jury indicted him in the shooting of a man who was wounded during an arrest last summer. Jacob Ramsey, a five-year veteran with the Kansas City Police Department, faces charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. A Jackson County judge entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. Investigators say Ramsey shot 37-year-old Anthony Contreras on June 24 after police went to Contreras' home to serve an arrest warrant. KCTV reported the warrant stemmed from Contreras' failure to appear in court on earlier charges of burglary, tampering with a motor vehicle and resisting arrest. Police said Contreras was shot while trying to run away. His family and friends insisted at the time that he was unarmed. Authorities have not commented on whether Contreras was found to have a weapon. Ramsey waived his right to a jury trial through his attorney Friday and requested that a judge decide the case. A trial has been scheduled for April 2. Ramsey, 31, is on unpaid administrative leave, police Capt. Tye Grant said in a statement. Grant declined to comment further and referred questions to the Jackson County prosecutor.

32f0fc90e4f5d44f887c284a5c77961bd0f29265,"(CNN) -- Murder-suicides, by their very nature, leave a mountain of unanswered questions. When the killer pulls the trigger first on his victim and then himself, he takes with him to the grave the reasons that compelled the angry, desperate act. Not so in the case of Radcliffe Haughton. What prompted the 45-year-old former Marine to open fire at a suburban Milwaukee salon Sunday -- killing his wife and two other women, and wounding four others -- was foreshadowed in no uncertain terms by his estranged wife just three days earlier. At a restraining order hearing Thursday, the wife, Zina, begged the court for protection, saying her husband would surely kill her. With her voice shaking, she outlined how he'd threatened to throw acid in her face. How he accused her of cheating on him. How his red hot jealousy terrorized her ""every waking moment."" ""Things have gotten so bad. We need to separate,"" she said at the hearing, according to a recording obtained by CNN affiliate WISN. ""We need a divorce before you hurt me. I don't want to die.""

The news reduces the chances of Wenger being forced into playing a makeshift midfield against the Reds due to a string of injuries. Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey are both out, leaving Wenger to consider playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role alongside Flamini with Lukas Podolski out wide. Oxlade-Chamberlain, meanwhile, has admitted that he and the rest of the Gunners squad must take some of the blame for their poor form. Arsene Wenger had been considering playing Santi Cazorla in a deep role against Brendan Rodgers' side . Wenger is hoping to take the Gunners back into the top four with victory at Anfield this weekend . Speaking to the Evening Standard, the former Southampton star said: 'From my point of view, Arsene Wenger is an unbelievable man off the pitch and as a manager.

Ben Nelson of Nebraska on Saturday threw his support behind the Democrats' health care reform bill, giving the party the crucial backing it needed to avoid a Republican filibuster that would prevent a Senate vote. The first of a series of votes is set for Monday at 1 a.m., on a so-called manager's amendment, consisting of amendments crafted in the last week-and-a-half by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. At the request of Republicans, the entire package of amendments -- 383 pages -- was being read Saturday, for hours, on the Senate floor. The Senate could vote on the entire bill, a top priority of President Obama, before Christmas. However, a House Democratic leadership source told CNN that Obama's repeated requests for a health care bill to arrive on his desk by the end of the year won't be met. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the ongoing internal discussions within the party, said there is ""no chance of a conference between Christmas and New Year's."" Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said the latest version of the Senate health care bill ""is a legislative train wreck of historic proportions."" ""If [Democrats] were proud of this bill, they wouldn't be doing it this way,"" McConnell said.

In a video they show how moving the planets closer would fill our sky with stunning views - and it reveals just how large some of the planets are compared to the moon. Scroll down for video . A YouTube user from Alabama has illustrated planets in the night sky (Saturn shown). They illustrated how the planets would look in the moon's position. The video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario. If it did happen, it's unlikely Earth would survive the close encounters . The video was created by YouTube user Yeti Dynamics. ‘This is a visualization of what it might be like if the Moon was replaced with some of the other planets at the same distance as our moon,’ they explain. Moon: 1,080 miles (1,738km) Mars: 2,111 miles (3,397km) Venus: 3,761 miles (6,052km) Neptune (equatorial): 15,701 miles (25,269km) Uranus (equatorial): 15,882 miles (25,559km) Saturn (equatorial, not including rings): 37,449 miles (60,268km) Jupiter (equatorial): 44,422 miles (71,490km) In order the video shows Mars, Venus, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn in place of the moon. Mercury is purposefully left off as it is a similar size to the moon ‘and hence is boring.’ With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth. Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km). Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km). Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth. Dione, for example, which orbits Saturn at a distance of 235,000 miles (377,000km), would likely impact Earth if Saturn were in place of the moon.

Repeat: Tony Martin, who killed an intruder in 1999, has been burgled again and he chased the intruder off his farm . A farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar has told how he was too scared to tackle an intruder this week in case he was branded a criminal. Tony Martin, 67, confronted a man stealing a tractor battery on Thursday, but felt he had to let him go. The pensioner said he wished he had tried to stop him, but was afraid to defend his property after being locked up in 2000. Mr Martin, who no longer holds a gun licence, said he realised ‘it would be me in trouble’. He added: ‘I couldn’t face going through all that again.’ The farmer fired three shots in 1999 after finding two burglars inside his remote Cambridgeshire home. He killed Fred Barras, 16, and wounded his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 29. Mr Martin was initially jailed for nine years after being convicted of murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter on appeal, and he was released after three years. The case sparked fierce debate over whether homeowners should be given greater legal protection to defend their property. Two days ago, Mr Martin caught a man breaking into a barn on his 14-acre property, but felt powerless to stop him. He said he had already been burgled ‘two or three times’ since he was released from jail. He said: ‘I could easily have made it, and fought him for what he’d stolen, but then it quickly flashed through my mind that it would be me in trouble, not him. ‘There were weapons inside the shed so, if I had wanted to fight him off, I could have. I wished I had but, after everything I’ve been through in the past, I just couldn’t face all that hassle again. ‘I haven’t changed my views about what happened in 1999, but the whole experience has made me lose faith in the system and I didn’t want to be made out as the criminal again.’ Mr Martin, who never moved back into the farmhouse ","Claims he chased thief yelling: 'Come back again and I'll sort you my way'

When the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis released of a list of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, victims' groups complained it was incomplete. Harry Walsh wasn't on the list of 30 priests made public two weeks ago. But church documents obtained by Minnesota Public Radio show he had been accused in the 1990s of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul in the early 1980s. The archdiocese contributed to a financial settlement for the girl in 1996. Nonetheless, two archbishops allowed him to continue working in parishes until the fall of 2011, MPR reported. Accused: Harry Walsh, 79, is accused of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul, Minnesota, in the early 1980s . Archbishop John Nienstedt asked Pope Benedict last year to defrock Walsh after he learned of the abuse allegations from documents in church archives, as well as an old internal investigation that determined Walsh had an affair with a married parishioner at a church in Monticello. Walsh agreed to leave. Walsh now teaches sex education to troubled teenagers and vulnerable adults in Wright County. He signed a two-year, $1,508-a-month contract this year, according to public records. Claims: Walsh served at Holy Redeemer parish in Detroit from 1965 until 1967. In 1994, a woman reported that Walsh had sexually abused her there when she was a 15-year-old girl . He told the station he never sexually abused children.'I'd have been shocked if I was on the list because there's nothing credible about it,' Walsh told MPR. 'If I were hiding that, you wouldn't be in my house right now; I would have been very careful.' In 1997, Walsh contributed to a book called 'How I Got into Sex', which drew on the experiences of 'sex therapists, educators, prostitutes, sex toy designers, sex surrogates, transsexuals, criminologists and clergy.'

Downloadable games that encourage children to spend parents' cash to proceed are being probed by the Office of Fair Trading . Video games that pressure children into spending hundreds of pounds when playing online face a crackdown from the Office Of Fair Trading. Many computer, console and mobile phone games offer players the opportunity to buy extra lives or abilities when online. It has led to many parents being left with huge credit card or mobile phone bills. Now an OFT investigation has found children are particularly vulnerable because they could feel they are letting other players down if they do not buy the content. Many games also blurred the distinction between spending virtual currency and real money and used statements or images to encourage children to make a purchase. The investigation found some games included ‘potentially unfair and aggressive commercial practices to which children may be particularly susceptible’. Now the OFT has proposed payments made by children while playing games online will not be deemed authorised, and should not be taken, unless the account holder - such as a parent - has given their informed consent. And they state that consumers should be told upfront about potential costs for playing the games, and any other important information such as whether their personal details will be shared with third parties. But Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has criticised the OFT proposals as ‘flaccid’. He said: ‘When games like My Little Pony and others charge £69 a pop for children to buy “gems”, there is something almost sinister happening. ‘Many of these free games take advantage of children’s confusion between virtual and real money and some parents’ technical illiteracy. ‘The OFT consultation is flaccid - the problems are apparent and games makers and app stores need to be held to account.

According to Dutch website OneMoreThing, the finished ship was launched at shipbuilder Koninklijke De Vries in Aalsmeer, The Netherlands. Jobs' widow Laurene and three of their children, Reed, Erin and Eve, were at the ceremony. The Jobs family gave each of the members of the shipbuilding staff an elegant thank-you note, along with a token gift of their appreciation â€” an iPod Shuffle with the name of the ship inscribed on the back. The yacht appears to be as it was described in the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson. In the book, Isaacson wrote about Jobs showing him models and architectural drawings of the yacht, which Isaacson described as ""sleek and minimalist."" 10 great quotes from Steve Jobs . According to the report, the enormous yacht is between 230 and 260 feet long, and appears to be as it was described in the Jobs biography â€” it's an extraordinary vessel with teak decks and large panes of ceiling-to-floor glass throughout. The boat is said to have seven 27-inch iMacs on board, and a photo showed six of them lined up on a single counter (see gallery below â€” by the way, you can see 7 iMacs on the bridge in exterior photos of the ship). Did Apple's fanboy fever peak with Steve Jobs? The late Apple CEO was aware he might not live to see the boat launched, but continued to tinker with its design. Now, at its christening more than a year after his death, his quotes about the yacht become even more poignant. In the Isaacson book, Jobs said, ""I know that it's possible I will die and leave Laurene with a half-built boat. But I have to keep going on it. If I don't, it's an admission that I'm about to die."" Update: Here are pics of the yacht, courtesy OneMoreThing, used with permission.

And while the issue may not be exclusive to that area, it's the stuff disputes are made of in what Sasha's dad, Matt Gross, calls the kid-heavy ""greater stroller zone"" of Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods.

The adults who bring their offspring to bars, she suggests, are ""clinging to their youth."" Parents, on the other hand, say that as long as they're responsible and their kids behave, they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends. And, they might add, in a place like New York -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out, too.

But that hasn't stopped Sidhe, the developers behind countless rugby league games, trying their hand at what's proving to be a difficult sport to crack. Scrum's the word: Rugby Challenge may have some flaws, but it's on course to be a solid sports game . First impressions are promising. Menu screens are clear and crisp, and there's a FIFA-style glossiness to the animated background. Content is rich, too, boasting a Single Match, Competition, online and career modes to name but a few. It's also heavily licenced - with more than 110 teams and 50 stadia looking exactly how they should. This includes heavy hitters such as the All Blacks, Australia and the Lions, not to mention smaller teams in the RaboDirect PRO12 and Ranfurly Shield. Unfortunately, South African teams are not licenced. But for all of this authenticity, the gameplay feels very arcade like - a move which may anger purists. Fast and ferocious, there's often so much happening on screen that it's difficult to tell what's going on. Core mechanics such as passing, tackling and kicking work well, though, and although AI running lines are not as refined as rugby fans may like, it's still very enjoyable. Less enjoyable are the tedious scrum and lineout mechanics. Both involve time-sensitive button and controller presses to ensure success, but the margin for error is extremely punishing. The decision to put all out-of-hand kicking into slow-motion, too, also jars with the ebb and flow of a match. Graphically, Rugby Challenge 2 largely looks the part.

'An independent report . said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services,' Mr Balls said today. 'They . said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of . children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth . that the person who was leading that department and responsible ends up . walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money. 'The payout is something that will appal people across the country. What it can't do is bring back a little boy who lost his life because he . was failed by Sharon Shoesmith and that department. That's the truth . and that will never change.' Silence: Haringey Council is refusing to disclose how much the settlement with Ms Shoesmith cost taxpayers .

510d5954f297660cf45478a5945633fdcafef432,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani court on Thursday postponed a decision on whether to grant bail to a Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Quran in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the capital, Islamabad. The Pakistani authorities have come under pressure to guarantee the safety of the girl, identified as Rimsha, in a country where people accused of blasphemy have been killed by members of the public in the past. Tahir Naveed Choudhry, one of Rimsha's lawyers, has sought bail for her, saying she is legally a minor and should be reunited with her parents rather than kept in a jail where adults are also being held. To back up his argument, Choudhry cited a report on Tuesday by an independent medical board stating that Rimsha was 14. The doctors who examined her also concluded that her mental age was lower than her chronological age. But on Thursday, the lawyer for the man accusing Rimsha queried the legal validity of the board's report. The lawyer, Rao Abdur Raheem, said the seven-doctor board was constituted by the local authorities, not by court order. As a result, the court adjourned until Saturday to allow time to verify the medical report. Raheem said he was representing the accuser free of charge because he believes God will reward him for his work. The police have said that Rimsha is illiterate and has not attended school. They said last week that she had told them that she had no idea that there were pages of the Quran inside the documents she alleged to have burned. The court faces a difficult decision amid concerns that if Rimsha is released on bail, she could be at risk from Muslims angered by the allegations against her. Choudhry, who is also a leading member of the Christian community and member of the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, said Rimsha is too young to stay in prison and would be safer joining her family, who are now in hiding.

696731f0ed7cc4a1551cbe2934a1b51feb60df98,"(CNN) -- Fourteen months to the day after an earthquake devastated Christchurch's 19th century cathedral, work is starting on a new center of worship reflecting the spirit of 21st century design. The ""cardboard"" cathedral designed by Japanese architect Shigeru Ban is a temporary structure which will accommodate 700 worshipers while a new permanent cathedral is built. ""The Transitional Cathedral is a symbol of hope for the future of this city as well as being sustainable and affordable,"" Richard Gray from the Transitional Cathedral Group said in a statement. The A-framed structure, which uses cardboard tubes along with timber, steel and a concrete base, is also the most stable shape for buildings in earthquake zones, according to Ban. Designed by English architect George Gilbert Scott, Christchurch Cathedral was badly damaged in the earthquake which struck the city on New Zealand's south island on February 22 2011 claiming 185 lives. The initial 6.3-maginitude shock toppled its spire with aftershocks in the following months causing further destruction, including the west wall and its ornate rose window. In March this year, Bishop Victoria Matthews announced the cathedral would be demolished because of the ""staggering"" costs of repair estimated to be up to NZ$100 million ($82 million). The new building will go up on the site of St John's Latimer Square, another church nearby which also collapsed in the earthquake. Shigeru Ban's cardboard creation builds on previous work using the material, including paper log houses which provided emergency shelter following the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan and a ""paper bridge"" which was erected on a site near the Pont du Gard in southern France. The cathedral is the largest emergency structure he has designed and will cost around NZ$5 million ($4 million) to complete. ""It's a symbol of life. New life in Christ for Christians, and it's right beside a place of death, and life is stronger than death,"" Bishops Matthews told TVNZ.

NUT members, meeting in Brighton for their annual conference, will . today call for the abolition of early testing, claiming it 'creates an . unhealthy environment of competition' and 'does little but engender a . feeling of failure in children and pressure on teachers'.

They are typically shocked not because I'm pregnant with my second child but because they've watched me suffer through hyperemesis gravidarum during both of my pregnancies. They know that pregnancy for me is never a glowing and magical journey. Rather, it is weekly trips to the emergency room, in-home IVs and nursing care, up to 13 medications with their assorted side effects and, of course, frequent vomiting -- sometimes as many as 20 times a day. Although I normally choose to greet my acquaintances' surprise with a simple smile and ""We'll see how I feel about it later,"" I decided to speak out after learning that Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their second child.

Hyperemesis gravidarum manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy. Because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations, you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before you're out of the ""danger zone"" of the first trimester, making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if you've suffered a miscarriage. Since you are so sick, what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare, as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner, and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially. Hyperemesis gravidarum even managed to take away the joy of feeling my daughter Hannah kick once I realized her movements were setting off the nausea.

He said: 'The amount of spare generation at the peak has gone down from about 15 per cent to this winter when we'll be about five per cent. Next winter will be even smaller. 'So will we get through this winter? Yes. Will we get through next winter? I don't know.' The warning came as the chief corporate officer of ScottishPower today warned the Government's carbon tax, which charges companies for burning fossil fuels, could make the country 'even more vulnerable to the threat of blackouts'.

""The individual was transferred to the hospital by the Scottish Ambulance Service yesterday after falling ill while visiting Torridon in the Scottish Highlands."" Meanwhile, a health care worker who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus after returning to Scotland from Sierra Leone was transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London. The patient is Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, the hospital said. She was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, said Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. She traveled via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport before arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight late Sunday, the health agency NHS Scotland said. After feeling unwell, she sought medical attention and became the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola within the United Kingdom. British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children.

Most of the victims were children aged under five whose parents likely bought the Australian native lizards from pet stores, according to a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Authorities have traced the infection back to a range of breeders who may have kept the reptiles in unhygienic conditions before selling them to pet shops.

Cell with HIV:  Nearly nine million adults worldwide living with HIV receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) which keeps the virus from multiplying by killing the virus in the bloodstream. Researchers found a 20-year-old HIV-positive adult on ART may be expected to live into their early 70's . The life expectancies of nearly 23,000 individuals on ART - which consists of the combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs to best suppress the HIV virus and stop the progression of HIV disease - were calculated based on mortality rates in the early to mid-2000s. Participants in the study, by the North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design and the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, were aged 20 years or older. Changes in life expectancy from 2000 to 2007 among HIV-positive individuals were evaluated by selected sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, such as drug use history and immune cell counts. The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that life expectancy at age 20 increased from 36.1 to 51.4 years from 2000-2002 to 2006-2007.

Since 1990, rising inequality knocked almost 7 percentage points off growth in the US, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said. The global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy, and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives. Economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor, according to the OECD . Countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality, the body's latest report states. 'The gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most OECD countries, it said. As a result, income inequality has curbed economic growth 'significantly'. The overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth, pulling away from the rest of society. But the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes 'slipping behind'. The OECD said: 'This negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40% of income earners.' In part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education, making it harder for them to increase their earning potential. The report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010. It found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 7 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the US. It is estimated to have reduced growth by 10 points in Mexico and New Zealand, almost 9 points in the UK and between six and seven Italy and Sweden in the two decades pre-recession. The report could put pressure on Barack Obama to do more to target t","Inequality gap wider than at any point in 30 years in most countries .

The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. Four to five feet of snow is on the ground, including about two feet of fresh powder, where the gunman escaped. ""There's a lot of snow on the ground, (and) it would be difficult to move through quickly,"" Taylor told CNN. ""And it's heavily forested."" The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called ""a normal traffic stop"" around 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m. ET). But the suspect didn't heed a request to pull over, prompting a ranger to radio ahead requesting assistance. Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock. ""When he (the shooter) arrived at that spot, he got out (of his car) and fatally shot her,"" said Taylor. The suspect then ran into the spacious national park, whose border is about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The park -- the centerpiece being the 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, which is considered an active volcano -- comprises 235,625 acres in the Cascade Range. Entrances to the park were closed after the shooting. Taylor said that authorities were able to ""evacuate most of the people ... safely,"" with more than 100 people ""holed up in our primary visitor center"" with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard. ""We don't want to try to have those people get to their vehicle and caravan down the park road where it could be dangerous, being sniped at by a gunman,"" the spokeswoman said Sunday night.

The recommendation would more than double the current top U.S. rate of income tax - 39.6 per cent - and runs counter to more than two decades of economic orthodoxy. At the moment fewer than one per cent of Americans reach the top income tax bracket of $406,750 for individuals and $457,600 for couples, yet the topic is one of the most emotive in U.S. politics.

Low rates: This graph shows how the U.S. income tax rate has fluctuated in the past century . Fabian Kindermann from the University of Bonn and Dirk Krueger from the University of Pennsylvania make the case for radically higher rates of taxation in a new paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their conclusions come nearly 25 years after the idea that the wealthy should be allowed to keep as much of their money as possible became the accepted political norm. Beginning with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, spurred by the new ideology of neoliberalism, the U.S. saw radical cuts to the top rate of income tax until it fell to less than 30 per cent. The architects of these policies were spurred by ideologues like the radical capitalist Ayn Rand, an originator of the 'wealth creator' myth, who believed rational self-interest would create the most-perfect economic conditions. Taking money out of the hands of the rich was not only unjust, she and her acolytes believed, but also economically illiterate, since those who were best at making money would know the best way to spend it.

Qatar is one of only three countries -- the others are Saudi Arabia and Brunei -- which have never sent female athletes to an Olympics Games. This year, three women will represent Qatar at London 2012. The others are swimmer Nada Arkaji and sprinter Noor al-Malki. All three women have been given wild cards, but there is still a weight of expectation that is not lost of Al-Hamad. ""It's an accomplishment for every Qatari woman,"" she said. ""I hope I can live up to their expectation."" Training at her shooting club outside Qatar's capital Doha, Al-Hamad added: ""Every athlete's dream is to reach the Olympics."" Competing in London in July and August will be a high point in her life as well as a historic moment for Qatar. ""I will be very excited to go see the atmosphere there and it will sure be one the most special days of my life,"" she said. Al-Hamad has won several regional competitions in the 10-meter rifle shooting category, but missed out on automatically qualifying for London 2012 by half a point. She said she was asleep when she received a call to say she had been awarded a wild card. ""I wanted to scream,"" she said. ""I really loved it. I was optimistic, but never expected to reach the Olympics. ""My dream when it comes to shooting is to be the Olympic or world champion."" See also: Will Saudi women make Olympics debut? One of her shooting club colleagues, Ali Rashid al-Mohannadi, 21, Gulf and Arab champion, and a senior engineering student, said he has nothing but respect for Al-Hamad.

This article originally appeared in the September 20, 2009, issue of Parade and Parade.com. (Parade) -- I am going to let you in on a secret: When a person's heart stops beating, it's not the end. Contrary to what you may think, death is not a single event. Instead, it's a process that can be interrupted. Sanjay Gupta says the latest CPR techniques can save the lives of vicitims of cardiac arrest. Mike Mertz knows this firsthand. On January 23, 2008, the 59-year-old Arizona man was driving home from work. The last thing he remembers is pulling into his complex's driveway. Then his heart stopped. Corey Ash, a passing UPS driver, noticed a silver Saturn wedged between a palm tree and a wall, with the engine running and a person slumped at the wheel. Ash stopped to investigate. He switched off the car's engine, pulled Mertz out, and laid him on the ground. Ash called 911 and started pumping the older man's chest. The next few minutes would be absolutely critical for Mertz. If you had been there, standing over Mertz's lifeless body, would you have known what to do? A person's life can slip away in a few minutes. Without a heartbeat, circulation slows to a halt. Blood no longer flows to the organs, and the brain is the first one to suffer. In normal times, the brain, which constitutes 2 percent of our body mass, consumes about 20 percent of the oxygen the body takes in. After 10 seconds without oxygen, the brain's functions slow. Without oxygen or signals from the brain, other organs begin to break down. Diaphragm muscles no longer contract and release to bring in air. The kidneys stop filtering blood. At the same time, an elaborate chain reaction triggers a breakdown in cells throughout the body. Parade.com: 4 diseases you can fight with exercise . Scientists and physicians are now learning that this process can be reversed. When it comes to cardiac arrest, ","Gupta: Death is not a single event; it's a process that can be interrupted .

President Obama during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics. ""When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,"" the Democrat told students at Emory University on Wednesday. ""I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African-American,"" he added. The controversy erupted this week when Carter first raised the race issue to NBC. ""An overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man,"" he said. Bill Cosby, a black comedian and actor, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter. ""During President Obama's speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,"" he said. CNN contributor David Gergen said that some of the allegations of race-baiting might have some weight among Democratic voters. ""Jimmy Carter, I'm afraid, is not alone in his views,"" he said. But Gergen warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to Obama's ideology. ""But I think it's wrongheaded, and I think it's unfair, and I think it's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents, most of the opponents of health care reform, to say that they're racist,"" he said.

The figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘must do more’ to help toddlers learn. Despite improvements in most parts of the country since last year, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah insisted that ‘too few young children are ready for school’. The figures show that just 59 per cent of boys can write a simple sentence or a letter to Father Christmas at the age of five against three-quarters of girls. Just 68 per cent of boys can read simple sentences compared with 80 per cent of their female classmates. Commenting on the figures, Mr Gyimah said: ‘We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond. ‘The statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are put on the right path. ‘Parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care, they’re not only safe, happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends","Figures were based on assessments of children at end of reception year .

In a move intended to reduce checkpoint congestion while improving security, flight attendants will be allowed to display credentials instead of undergoing physical screening. They will still be subject to random, unpredictable searches, however. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the change is in keeping with his philosophy of ""risk-based"" security, because it speeds up screening of known ""low-risk"" travelers, while allowing TSA screeners to focus on unknown travelers. Authorities investigate needles in sandwiches . Flight attendant representatives have long argued that flight attendants deserve the same treatment as pilots because they undergo identical background checks and are entrusted with access to the cockpit. The Known Crewmember program is ""good news"" for U.S. aviation, flight attendants and the traveling public, said Veda Shook, head of the Association of Flight Attendants. ""We are the last line of defense in security aboard the aircraft,"" Shook said. In addition, the program will eliminate flight attendants' ""uncomfortable"" practice of jumping to the head of the security line so they can make their flights on time, she said. High-flying family shares travel secrets . In May, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security instructed the TSA to include flight attendants in the Known Crewmember program. Flight attendants -- there are 90,000 of them in the United States -- will be eligible if they work for U.S. airlines that participate in the program and are flying from U.S. airports.

The question is whether that would help the situation. No one argues that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 gives Obama the authority to take over all efforts to plug the well gushing 5,000 feet beneath the surface. However, officials of oil giant BP, while acknowledging their failure so far to stop the leak, say no one -- not even the U.S. government -- can match their company's know-how and technology in such a crisis. ""I don't think anyone else could do better than we are,"" Doug Suttles, the BP chief operating officer, said Monday. ""I know that that's frustrating to hear and our performance, to this point, I wish was better. I wish this was done. But we're doing everything we can. And I don't actually believe anyone could do any better, unfortunately."" Administration officials also have said they lack the technology -- such as unmanned submarines that can work at such ocean depths -- that has been deployed by BP. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who previously threatened a government takeover of the mission, made clear Monday that BP must be involved in trying to stop the leaking oil. ""There are areas where BP and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight, such as a deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to kill the well,"" Salazar said Monday. ""BP and the private sector, with the help of federal scientists, are the ones who must get that problem solved and we have the oversight capacity in the administration to make sure that they are doing that."" In addition, the administration's point man on the spill response, Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen, said Monday that BP's strategies were endorsed by other top oil company executives and he would advise against any shift from BP's continued involvement.

An extremely rare set of 400-year-old playing cards made of silver and gold that were owned by a princess have been discovered. The extraordinary deck of ‘silver cards’ gilded with gold were first sold at auction at Christie’s auction house for £2,421,123 in 2010. Recently a historian described them as one of only five known decks of silver cards and the only complete set. Gilded with gold: The set of 'silver cards' is one of only five known decks and the only complete set and was created around 1616 . Legend has it that the cards were owned by Portuguese princess Infanta Carlota Joaquina, who married a prince in Portugal before fleeing to Brazil when Napoleon’s armies marched into Iberia in 1807. Stories say she took the set with her. Timothy Schroder, a historian specialising in gold and silver decorative arts, recently wrote in his book: ‘Only five sets of silver cards are known today and of these only one — the Zilkha set (referring to the current owner) — is complete. ‘They were not made for playing with but as works of art for the collector's cabinet, or Kunstkammer.’ Creating the silver cards was a hazardous job as each of the 52 cards was gilded using mercury, a deadly chemical, a process which is illegal today. Even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous. Risky process: Mercury was used to gild the gold to the silver - a process which is illegal today and even in Renaissance times, people knew the process was dangerous . Mr Schroder was quoted in Live Science saying: ‘I don't think they quite understood why it was dangerous, but they did appreciate the dangers of it. ‘You ground up gold into kind of a dust, and you mix it with mercury, and you painted that onto the surface where you wished the gilding to appear.’ He explained that the mercury disperses in the kiln in a process ‘that would leave the gold chemically bonded to the silve","They are one of just five known sets and the only complete set .

You start out with a truffle soup, followed by oysters and then a main course of flounder with risotto and vegetables. There's a side of potatoes and you finish it off with a scoop of ice cream. Here's the twist -- this all comes with a generous helping of dirt. Not normal, backyard variety dirt, special nutrient-rich soil. The unique tasting menu is the creation of Toshio Tanabe, a former gymnast and boxer turned culinary inventor. Tanabe says the dirt menu was a logical addition for his quaint restaurant, Ne Quittez Pas, which is located in Tokyo's Gotanda neighborhood. ""This is a seafood restaurant, so we have the flavors from the ocean,"" he says. ""I was also looking for flavors from the earth."" The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . But this is not the typical dirt you'd find it your backyard. It comes from a garden wholesaler, which provides the high quality soil, taken deep beneath the earth's surface -- 10 meters down, in fact. Germaphobes can take some comfort, perhaps. Tanabe tells us the soil is first lab tested, and then heated to extreme temperatures, to kill off any bacteria. After that process is complete Tanabe will work it into his menu. This special fare is certainly not dirt cheap. The set course is about US$110 per person. And how does it taste? According to one adventurous eater, who wished to remain anonymous the night of our visit, ""I didn't think it would be real dirt. I was a bit nervous. But it was a subtle taste."" When we ask Tanabe, about his next key ingredient, he shrugs and says he's not sure. ""This idea came about naturally.""

Regardless of what might be said by politicians, Iraqi or not, Western intervention to aid Baghdad in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) does not constitute a solution to the current crisis, nor does it work towards one. Far from it: direct military intervention by a Western state -- even if Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is requesting it -- would dramatically worsen the situation, and ISIS, contrary to what pro-interventionists might say, would inevitably come out on top. While all options might, as John Kerry said this week, remain on the table at this point, some are more ""on it"" than others. Indeed, it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western ""boots on the ground"" (besides a very limited presence to secure national assets). If there were to be any intervention,  therefore, it seems likely it would take the form of ""targeted strikes"" from the air -- be they via drones, jets or missiles. And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on ""ISIS strongholds"" in order to ""minimize civilian casualties."" Removed from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS. Indeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent ""Crusader threat"" and defend the group's false legitimacy. In short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become.

With chest puffed out and a javelin at his side, the 35-year-old's stance has a classical feel, but with a distinctly modern twist. In the dying light of a frigid November day in the Icelandic capital, the jagged silhouette of a carbon fiber running blade can be made out before its tip trails into the inky murk beneath. The prosthetic limb has helped Sveinsson become one of the most successful para-athletes of recent times propelling him to the top of the podium in the javelin over the last two seasons. At the 2013 world championships in Lyon, France, he took gold and repeated the feat earlier this year at the European Championships with a winning throw of 50.74 meters competing in the F42 class -- a category for athletes who have suffered amputations above the knee. ""I just love everything about the javelin,"" Sveinsson told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's just the feeling when you hit the sweet spot -- when you're throwing a perfect throw, there's nothing that compares to that ... it's the perfect feeling."" Like most Paralympic competitors, Sveinsson has had plenty thrown at him during his life. A talented handball player in his youth, Sveinsson looked to be heading for the professional ranks when, on the cusp of adulthood, his life took an abrupt and tragic turn. ""I was 18 years old when I started feeling little bits of pain in my leg. And then the pain got worse, and worse, and worse,"" he explains. A period of agonizing limbo involving hospital visits, tests and scans came to a horrifying conclusion with a diagnosis of bone cancer.

bf96ac83fa186e7d5f956be7cefc94650fe9cc9f,"(CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal ""cash for clunkers"" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse. ""I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" said Andrew Sable, who got $9,000 for his 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The gas-guzzling 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee his college-student son drives went bad last weekend. Ordinarily Sable would have fixed it, even though the vehicle was worth perhaps $2,000 at best. But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser. And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive. The $9,000 in savings knocked the price to $8,900 before taxes and fees. ""I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way]. I'd have been foolish not to take it,"" the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com. He'll drive the PT Cruiser and let the son drive his Nissan. iReport.com: Read Sable's account of the purchase . Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient. The old vehicles are crushed or shredded.  Watch CNN's Gerri Willis explain the ""cash for clunkers"" program » . The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets. Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type. New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg. New SUVs and small or medium pickup trucks or vans must get at least 18 mpg. New large vans and pickups must get at least 15 mpg. The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg.

An Indiana man forced his wife to sign a sex slave contract so he could sexually abuse and torture her — while he coerced her by controlling her diabetes medication, police charge. Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes, forcing her to wear a choke collar and raping her repeatedly. He is charged with 38 felonies ranging from strangulation, criminal confinement and domestic battery, WHAS11 reported. Some of the charges stem from incidents that happened while his two kids were nearby, according to WBIW. Authorities say Harden wrote out an elaborate contract defining himself as the 'master' and his wife as the 'slave.' His wife said she couldn't leave not only because she 'loved him' — but also because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes, according to WHAS11. Seymour police arrested him on Saturday while responding to a domestic call at the couple's home. When officers arrived, they found Harden on the sidewalk while his distraught wife sobbed inside the apartment, WBIW reported. While investigating the call, police found an 11-page manual outlining 'the slave's role' and 'punishments,'  which was signed by both Harden and his wife in June, according to the station. The victim, who is not named because she was a victim of sexual abuse, said Harden forced her to sign the contract or he would leave her. She told cops that he was 'sweet' and 'swept her off her feet' when they first met via Craigslist in July 2013, according to WBIW. But soon he told her was a sadist and wanted to be her master, the station reported. The woman said he at times tied her to her bed for so long, she would urinate on herself, according to WBIW. She would often lose her consciousness during the torture sessions, court records show.","Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes and torturing her repeatedly under a 'master' and 'slave' contract he made her sign .

""What is very troubling about this case is that the Russians are making very wild accusations against the (adoptive) parents before they have information,"" a senior State Department official told CNN. ""I think it is irresponsible of the Russians to say the parents did x, y or z before we find out what happened.

Russian officials Tuesday met with the boy's unnamed adoptive parents and his surviving brother, also adopted from Russia, after the State Department coordinated the session through Texas Child Protective Services. U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, a Russian governor halted the foreign adoption of orphans in his region after the boy's death. ""If we know the facts and they are as the Russians claimed, they have every right to be upset just as we would be upset if an American child was adopted in Russia and the same thing happened.

That pending law would ban adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents.

eb190746426300f00cb244120091e5a9e7dc4d01,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has put the stoning sentence of a woman convicted of adultery and murder ""on hold,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told state-run Press TV on Wednesday. While the statement did not differ greatly from previous, sometimes contradictory reports from the Iranian government about the fate of the woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, it did indicate continued attention to the murder aspect of her case. ""The sentencing of Ms. Ashtiani for adultery has been stopped and (her case) is being reviewed again, and her sentencing for complicity in murder is in process,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning, but her son and human rights activists urged help for her this summer, prompting an international outcry. There have been conflicting reports about the murder charge, which relates to the death of Ashtiani's husband. Ashtiani's previous lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, said last month his client had been sentenced to death for the crime but that the sentence was commuted because the victim's family forgave her. Ashtiani, however, told the British newspaper The Guardian last month that she was acquitted of the murder in 2006. Ashtiani, who spoke to the newspaper through an intermediary, said the man who actually killed her husband was identified and imprisoned for the crime. Mehmanparast said those concerned about Ashtiani's condition should have some consideration for the family of the victim, according to Press TV. ""Defending a person on trial for murder should not be turned into a human rights matter,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani gave an interview to state-run TV last month in which she said she knew about a plot to kill her husband but that she had not taken it seriously at the time. ""The man entered my life and fooled me with his words and said let's kill my husband,"" she said in the interview, which was criticized by human rights groups. ""He fooled me and said I'll do this","Iran has made previous, similar statements amid international outcry .

Despite the innovative design, which is certainly quite prominent on our drinking culture, Aussies have also made a fundamental contribution to society for its rather radical ideas and inventions over the years.

The humble cask wine is celebrating a milestone, turning the ripe old age of 50 this year . This woman appears to be playing a round of 'Goon of Fortune' by pegging the bag of wine on a Hills Hoist clothesline - which was also invented by an Aussie . The invention of cask wine began when winemaker Thomas Angove of Renmark, northeast of Adelaide, designed a plastic bladder as an alternative for the traditional wine bottle. The bag is placed in a box and wine is poured through an air-tight valve. Son John Angove, who's now the managing director of Angove Family Winemakers, watched his father's invention come to life when it was patented on April 20, 1965. He told the ABC the idea evolved from his father talking about creating the sack in old goat skins to a plastic bag. 'He put the plastic bag inside a cardboard box and it just grew from that,' he said. 'It was a pretty amazing idea and I remember as a youngster thinking: 'god Dad that's crazy, that'll never work, who's going to buy wine in a plastic bag?"".' The invention has gained a lot of love over the years - also helping to Aussies to further develop drinking game 'Goon of Fortune', which involves pegging the bag of wine on a clothesline. And when the liquid goods have been consumed, it is then often reused as a makeshift pillow. CSIRO scientists were also behind the development of the method of Wi Fi in 1992 .

d062d19e150f69db6e5957ef12d670f5527caf5d,"(CNN) -- While China is seriously cracking down on the exchange of virtual currencies for real cash, virtual economies backed by newfound legitimacy elsewhere are quickly gaining ground in the real world. There's gold in them there screens: Real-money transactions in virtual worlds are finding new legitimacy. On June 24, 2009, the role-playing game 140 Mafia launched on Twitter, following in the footsteps of highly lucrative games Mob Wars and Mafia Wars on Facebook (and now iPhone) to link virtual-currency exchanges to real-money transactions. In March 2009, MindArk -- creator of the MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game) Entropia, where one player famously bought an island for US$26,500 in 2004 -- saw its wholly owned subsidiary Mind Bank granted a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The new license allows Mind Bank to be the first bank to directly incorporate real-money transactions with virtual-world activities. Selling virtual assets directly between players for real-world cash has been strictly prohibited by most game publishers, which find themselves looped out of the profits. What has been profitable in the meantime to some hardcore players of World of Warcraft and EverQuest (and other games) is ""gold farming"" -- accumulation of ""gold,"" weapons and other status symbols of a seasoned player -- followed by the online auction of such assets or user accounts. Since games publishers began policing eBay for this type of unauthorized activity, several Web sites such as PlayerAuctions have adopted a PayPal-like approach in order to broker the trading legally, acting as an open marketplace for player-to-player exchange of digital assets.

""I am really keen to work on something really new, which eventually is going to be important for the future of Nintendo,"" he said, through a translator, in an interview here at Nintendo's offices on Thursday. ""I would like to try to do something which might be able to expand the boundary or the definition of video games."" Miyamoto spoke with CNN the day after Wired reported that the game visionary would step down as a top Nintendo director and producer overseeing the development of games and products. CNN has a syndication agreement with Wired. A Nintendo spokeswoman disputed the Wired report, which quotes Miyamoto telling colleagues that he is ready to retire. Miyamoto was being sarcastic, but that nuance was lost in translation, she said. ""Miyamoto's role at Nintendo is not changing,"" the company said in a statement. ""He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts."" The 59-year-old video-game pioneer may spend less time working directly on blockbuster games in Nintendo's biggest franchises, he said. But he will have a senior role, which involves helping to determine the future direction of Nintendo's hardware and software. ""We've got to incorporate something new all the time,"" Miyamoto said. ""Everything starts from something small whenever we are trying to find out something new."" Miyamoto suggested in the interview that he may be tiring of shepherding each new entry into the franchises he dreamed up decades ago.

5f13ddb11f623d9de0af761aa14afa538a4f11fa,"(CNN) -- Mexico's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels, but it hasn't hurt its tourism industry, officials say. International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. ""The data doesn't lie,"" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. ""Tourists keep choosing Mexico."" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing ","Mexico remains the No. 1 destination for Americans traveling abroad .

Sarkozy is the first French president ever to visit the country which has in the past demanded huge reparations from France to compensate for slavery-era exploitation before Haitian independence two centuries ago . He told a news conference that an extra €100 million ($136 million) was being made available to help reconstruction efforts, bringing France's contribution to the the aid effort to €320 million. Sarkozy was scheduled to meet with Haitian President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and take a helicopter tour of earthquake-devastated zones, Sarkozy's office said. He also planned to tour a French Civil Security hospital and meet with French teams and injured Haitians, his office said. He planned to meet members of the government involved in reconstruction and members of the United Nations mission in Haiti. Sarkozy's trip was scheduled to last less than five hours, after which he planned to go to the French island of Martinique for an overnight stay. Thursday, Sarkozy planned to visit French Guiana on South America's northeastern coast before returning home, his office said. Sarkozy is the first European head of state to visit Haiti since the January 12 earthquake, Agence France-Presse reported. France has had close cultural ties with its former colony since independence, but diplomatic relations have sometimes been fraught, with Paris occasionally expressing concerns over instability in the Caribbean nation. In 2004, France called for the resignation of then president Jean Bertrand Arstide, who was subsequently ousted in a 2004 rebellion, after his government  demanded that France pay $21 billion in reparations.","Sarkozy expected to meet Haiti's president and prime minister on flying visit .

b4b3302f7df78aafb9286054ee04122336ac8cd0,"(CNN) -- The world of Dungeons & Dragons, the iconic role-playing game that has captivated millions since the 1970s, is more than just rolling dice on a table top. In 2014, it is computer games, books, online comics, miniature figurines and more, aimed at staying relevant in a digital age. Wizards of the Coast, the publishers of the game, is launching the latest version along with a massive campaign called Tyranny of Dragons. But on such a plethora of platforms, how is it possible to create an overarching idea that transcends platforms? The publishers say it's a simple concept known as sharing. The high adventure, in which followers of dragon queen Tiamat aim to take over the world, coincides with the release of the fifth edition of rules for tabletop version of D&D. But the company wanted to expand how players could join in the new storyline and create a community of shared experiences. ""The big part of a role-playing game is, you can do whatever you want. But we want you to end up at the same place at the end of the adventure,"" said Mike Mearls, senior manager for Dungeons & Dragons research and development. ""There are many ways to get there, but having a big event that brings everybody back together is part of the fun, because once you've gone up against Tiamat, you've got something you can talk to any fellow player about, even if you've never met that person before."" The idea of creating that shared story experience over different media meant Mearls had to think about the narrative differently. It was more about creating a story bible with direction on how various creatures behave in certain circumstances rather than plotting out each monster's actions specifically. 40 years later, 'Dungeons & Dragons' still inspiring gamers . ""Each one has a different way they act, a different goal they have,"" Mearls said.

af83548132ea85678e4c3bf24922fe3a53a95386,"In order to understand the turbulent world of Thai politics, you have to start with one name: Thaksin Shinawatra. The former prime minister has dominated the country's political scene for more than a decade despite going into exile after his ouster in a 2006 coup. Back in 2010, deadly clashes took place between security forces and Thaksin supporters who had occupied central Bangkok. They were demanding his return. Now, his sister is in power and she recently tried to pass an amnesty law that could have allowed his return. The attempt failed, but it provided fuel for the current protests shaking the capital. Here's a quick primer to make sense of it all. 1. Who is Thaksin? He's a deeply polarizing figure -- a billionaire telecommunications mogul who built his political power on policies popular with Thailand's rural villagers. His success ruffled a lot of feathers among the country's established elites, and critics accused him of corruption and autocratic rule. He was prime minister between 2001 and 2006, when the military deposed him in a bloodless coup. 2. What happened in 2010? Thaksin's ouster spurred the protest movement that developed over the years into the widespread ""red shirt"" demonstrations that occupied upscale parts of Bangkok in 2010. By that stage, the movement had broadened to represent other issues, including resentment at the military's involvement in politics and economic inequality. The crackdown by security forces on the red shirts resulted in clashes that left around 90 people dead. It has been described as the worst civil violence in Thailand's history, and the country remains severely scarred by the experience. 3. Could the current protests lead to a repeat? The situation is different this time. Those protesting are opponents of Thaksin rather than his supporters. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now prime minister. Her government is under pressure after widespread anger over its recent failed attempt to pass a bill that could have granted ","At the heart of the unrest is the polarizing figure of Thaksin Shinawatra .

04565cbd287f0a88669700a8191ab63f37939495,"(CNN) -- These are extraordinary times, and like a lot of Republicans I believe that a well-crafted stimulus plan is needed to put people back to work. But the Obama spending bill would stimulate the government, not the economy. Mitt Romney says Obama's spending bill would stimulate the government rather than the economy. We're on an economic tightrope. The package that passed the House is a huge increase in the amount of government borrowing. And we've borrowed so much already that if we add too much more debt, or spend foolishly, we could invite an even bigger crisis. We could precipitate a worldwide crisis of confidence in America, leading to a run on the dollar or hyperinflation that wipes out family savings and devastates the middle class. It's still early in the administration of President Obama. Like everyone who loves this country, I want him to adopt the correct course and then to succeed. He still has a chance to step in and insist on spending discipline among the members of his own party. It's his job to set priorities. I hope for America's sake that he knows that a chief executive can't vote ""present."" He has to say yes to some things and no to a lot of others. As someone who spent a career in the private sector, I'd like to see a stimulus package that respects the productivity and genius of the American people. And experience shows us what it should look like. First, there are two ways you can put money into the economy, by spending more or by taxing less. But if it's stimulus you want, taxing less works best. That's why permanent tax cuts should be the centerpiece of the economic stimulus.  Watch Romney make argument for tax cuts » . Second, any new spending must be strictly limited to projects that are essential. How do we define essential? Well, a good rule is that the projects we fund in a stimulus should be legitimate government priorities that would have been carried out in the future anyway, and are simply being moved up to create those jobs now.","Mitt Romney: We're in extraordinary times and we need to stimulate economy .

b2e7c3fd6b85ce48660d6b09ba9409ada6da7f61,"(CNN) -- The week-old redesign of quick-messaging service Twitter was meant to simplify its tools and make it more accessible to newbies. But it has had some unintended consequences. Independent developers of applications that tie into Twitter's network say they have experienced significant accelerations in downloads and revenue since Twitter 4.0 launched last week. When addicts of the social network got their hands on the new version, many recoiled upon seeing the changes. They were especially vocal about the loss of some features in Twitter's mobile apps and about the private-message tab being hidden within another menu. So thousands flocked to the various app stores to get third-party apps that look more like the previous version of Twitter. Some of the most popular apps cost a few dollars, unlike the free app made by Twitter. Tweetbot, an anime-themed app for the iPhone, more than doubled its usual revenue just after Twitter's major redesign, said Paul Haddad, a co-founder for app maker Tapbot. When the small developer cut the price of Tweetbot in half on Friday, to 99 cents, revenue increased more than tenfold, Haddad said. Independent trackers of app downloads verify that Tweetbot and others experienced big gains. ""Word of mouth really goes a long way on Twitter,"" Haddad wrote in an e-mail. The maker of another popular app, Twitterrific, saw a ""bump"" after the Twitter changes, which carried through to this week, said Craig Hockenberry, the head of app maker Iconfactory. This effect is common, but short-lived, after a major change to Twitter, he said. Twitterrific, which offers a free version with ads or a full version for $4.99, experienced a similar boost in March after Twitter updated its iPhone app with a much-maligned feature called the Quick Bar, Hockenberry said. The Quick Bar, which critics dubbed Dick Bar after Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, added an ever-present ticker showing trending topics and ads. Within a month, Twitter had removed the feature.

Slaven Bilic's team dominated the first half, and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but Olic's strike partner Mladen Petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to Vedran Corluka's cross. Austria's main threat had come from set-pieces, but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners. However, the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes. Martin Harnik fired over the bar on 78 as Croatia scrambled to clear the danger, then substitute Ivica Vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa, who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder. Pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from Umit Korkmaz, who also came off the bench, while another substitute in Roman Kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on. Croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets, having qualified top of their group ahead of Russia with a victory away to England which eliminated the British team. However, their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer Eduardo da Silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg. None of Croatia's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches, and the Arsenal forward's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on Sunday. The winning goal came after Modric and Olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in, and Pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away f","Croatia beat Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria 1-0 in opening Group B match .

Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. ""The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,"" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called ""white hat"" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001.

Newspaper speculation on Monday claimed the Italian was on the verge of walking out of Stamford Bridge after a turbulent few weeks at the London club. Chelsea have lost three of their last four matches and the club sacked Ancelotti's assistant Ray Wilkins earlier this month, sparking speculation over his position. It had been claimed the 51-year-old contacted the League Managers' Association on Sunday night to discuss his position. But at a press conference ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Slovakian side MSK Zilina on Tuesday, Ancelotti said the rumors were ""totally untrue"". ""I don't know if it is enough to clarify my position today to close this rumor and speculation,"" began the 51-year-old. ""These rumors are totally untrue, I don't know why this rumor came out today in the papers. ""The LMA (League Managers' Association) called me last night to understand what was happening, but I was at home. These rumors are totally untrue.

But he did his best to cook dinner each night and to spend quality time with his kids on weekends, and somehow, ""they ended up smarter than me,"" he jokes. Fast forward a few decades and Kizelewicz, now 63, is raising another family. He still makes dinner most nights but now he has a bigger home, a stable job and a wife whose additional income makes things much easier. Some people cautioned him against remarrying at 49, saying he was too old to start a new family. He had two complicated marriages behind him when his now-wife Natalie -- his son's coworker -- agreed to a date. He was 48 and dating for the first time since his children left the home; she was 29 and had just ended what she described as an emotionally abusive marriage to her first husband, with whom she had a daughter. She resisted at first because of the age difference, but when she finally gave in they immediately hit it off during their first date at Olive Garden.

Uruguayan skipper Godin has marshalled an Atletico defence which has not conceded in any of their last three games, since a 3-1 loss at Valencia.

4bd729c4f4caefb2cf5760a7ef1f84aa26efce75,"(CNN) -- There's a big difference between a political debate about same-sex marriage and the recent hard-fought court challenge to the California ban, Proposition 8. In politics, anything goes: Vague, sinister comments about same-sex marriage threatening children or undermining the sanctity of heterosexual marriage were prevalent during the Prop 8 campaign. In court, same-sex marriage opponents needed solid evidence to back up these and other claims. Despite ""able and energetic counsel,"" they never produced it. That's why they lost, resoundingly, in the federal district court. And that lack of evidence should dog opponents up through the chain of appeals that is now beginning, because appellate courts are required to review only the evidence in the court record and to give great deference to Judge Vaughn Walker's findings of fact. He was there, after all, presiding over the trial, and the appellate judges weren't. And what a lopsided trial he presided over. All the anti-same-sex marriage arguments imploded when subjected to the rules of evidence. ""You don't have to have evidence of this point,"" counsel responded to the judge's question asking what support existed for their claim that ""responsible procreation is really at the heart of society's interest in regulating marriage."" No, sorry, at trial, you do have to have evidence. Of this point and every point. (And since -- as even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once pointed out in another case -- the sterile and elderly are allowed to marry, it can't be all about procreation.) Trials turn on admissible evidence -- primarily credible witness testimony or documents, in this type of case. And Prop 8 proponents did not have it. Over and over again, Walker's decision focused on the evidence, the mountain of reliable facts offered by gay marriage advocates, and the glaring lack thereof proffered by gay marriage opponents. The same-sex-marriage advocates presented eight lay witnesses and nine expert witnesses. One plai","Lisa Bloom says political arguments don't necessarily hold up in court .

President Enrique Peña Nieto has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the disappearance of 43 college students, and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country. In September, a group of students boarded buses and vans bound for the nearby city of Iguala, intending to protest about a lack of funding for their school. They have not been heard from since. ""After Iguala, Mexico must change,"" Peña Nieto told a group of politicians and lawmakers. He proposed more than a dozen reforms, including a constitutional change that would give the state control over local police. The plan would be worked out in stages, starting with the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán and Tamaulipas, he said. The President also proposed setting up a nationwide emergency number, like 911 in the United States, and said he wants to boost development by creating three special economic zones in the country's impoverished south. Bodies found in southwestern Mexico . Peña Nieto spoke the same day authorities announced that 11 partially burned bodies of young adults have been found in southwestern Mexico, just an hour's drive from where 43 missing college students went to school. Police haven't publicly identified the remains, and officials have not said whether there is any connection between the bodies and the September disappearances of the 43 students -- a case that has led to unrest over allegations that police abducted them, on order of a mayor, and turned them over to a gang that killed them.

Here, ""gender identity"" refers not to one's biological sex, but to whether one feels male or female. One concern about ENDA is its impact on religious liberty. ENDA would effectively forbid employers to consider sexual conduct in evaluating the character of their employees or applicants. Although ENDA contains a limited ""religious exemption,"" there remain serious questions as to whether any exemption would be adequate to meet the concerns of people with religious and moral scruples against homosexual conduct. However, focusing only on the religious exemption plays into the false assumption that religious or moral objections to homosexuality are the only reason why anyone objects to this law. What's most significant about it may not be its impact on homosexual workers or religious employers, or the controversial insistence by LGBT activists that it cover transgender people as well. What really matters is the ratcheting up of federal government interference in the free market. Opinion: No one should be fired for being gay . The basic claim of most of the advocates of ENDA is that discrimination is wrong if based on factors ""not relevant to job performance."" But again, the question is who decides what is ""relevant to job performance"" -- the individual employer, or the government? The strong presumption should be in favor of the employer. Of course, federal law already interferes with private employment decisions with regard to a few specific characteristics. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars discrimination based on ""race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.""

The space agency announced Sunday that it has pushed back the start of the multi-day flight until Tuesday, a day later than planned. Storms forecast over the Southeast prompted the delay, NASA said in a statement announcing the postponement. NASA still hopes to deliver Endeavour, the baby of the shuttle fleet, to Los Angeles by Thursday, the agency said. The spacecraft and its Boeing 747 carrier are slated to make several stops and low-level flyovers along the route, with overnight stops in Houston -- home to the mission control center for the U.S. manned space program -- and at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center in southern California. Dryden is located at Edwards Air Force Base, the landing site for the first shuttle missions. The jet-shuttle combo will make low-altitude passes over NASA's Stennis Space Center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the agency's Michoud Assembly plant near New Orleans, where the shuttles' external fuel tanks were built; over the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, a last-resort landing site where shuttle pilots trained; and over San Francisco, Sacramento and other northern California sites. Endeavor is scheduled to be on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles by late October. Built as a replacement for the ill-fated shuttle Challenger, it made 25 flights into space between 1992 and 2011. The other two surviving orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis, are also being put on display at museums. Atlantis will be at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Discovery at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum annex in Virginia.","Forecasts storms push Endeavour's final flight back a day .

In a letter of protest to director Steven Spielberg, he said that although he thinks overall the film is tremendous and compelling, ""placing the State of Connecticut on the wrong side of the historic and divisive fight over slavery is a distortion of easily verifiable facts."" Screenwriter Tony Kushner conceded the discrepancy but defended the film. ""None of the key moments of that story -- the overarching story our film tells -- are altered,"" he said in a statement Thursday. He explained that the alterations were made to serve the narrative that the outcome of the vote was in doubt until the very end. ""I hope nobody is shocked to learn that I also made up dialogue and imagined encounters and invented characters,"" he added. ""I'm sorry if anyone in Connecticut felt insulted by these 15 seconds of the movie,"" Kushner said, but ""this is a dramatic film and not an attack on their home state."" Still, Courtney said Friday that he hoped the movie would be changed before it is released on DVD on February 26. ""The four members of Connecticut's delegation ... deserved a better legacy than the screenplay portrayed,"" he said.

More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz. The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston. When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. ""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Friday.

Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure. ""It may contain other stuff, too,"" said Galvin. ""We don't know that yet.""

Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a rare genetic disorder which occurs when the body fails to produce or respond to certain hormones while developing during pregnancy. Every foetus contains the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct, but if the baby is male then it will produce hormones meaning this reduces and then disappears all together. However in those with PMDS the body either does not produce these hormones, or does not react to them properly, meaning the duct develops into a functioning womb. Because these hormones do not affect the growth of the penis, it means the child will also develop typical exterior male genitals.

The deadly crush happened Saturday in an underpass between the main event site and an expansion area. Witnesses told CNN affiliate NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began when people began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. The Duisburg public prosecutor's office said 511 were injured. Of these, 283 people had to be treated in hospitals, and all but 43 have been released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a thorough investigation into the incident and said that she was ""horrified and saddened"" by the tragedy. Carsten Lueb of NTV said some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people they opened an additional event site. The numbers are disputed by police, who say the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 and at no time was it filled to capacity. NTV reported that 1,400 police officers were on hand to monitor the event. Detlef von Schmeling of the Duisburg police said more than 4,000 police officers provided security. Witnesses told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. An additional entryway had been opened before the accident to relieve some of the pressure. Police are investigating how the back-up came to occur in the underpass.","Twenty-one people have died in the tragedy .

A man who intentionally infected his girlfriend with HIV has been jailed after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. Alan Mason, 45, from Endmoor, Cumbria, discovered he had HIV three years before he had unprotected sex with the woman, but still didn't bother to tell her, Carlisle Crown Court heard. Mason was jailed for two years and eight months by Judge Paul Batty QC, who told him: 'I am of the view that you deliberately targeted this hapless, vulnerable woman.' The court was told that Mason, a divorced father of two, was diagnosed in 2008. He met the 39-year-old woman, from Barrow, in a pub in Kendal in March 2011, and began a relationship with her. When she began feeling ill while on holiday seven months later, her GP suggested she be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Prosecutor Alex Leach told the court that when she told Mason what the doctor had said, he broke down and told her he was HIV positive. He said that when a blood test later revealed that she, too, had HIV, she 'went into total shock' and thought she was going to die because of the 'alarming' amount of weight she lost, the Cumberland News reported.

The birds -- most of which were dead -- were red-winged blackbirds and starlings, and they were found within a one-mile area of Beebe, about 40 miles northeast of Little Rock, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said. Birds fell over about a one-mile area, the commission said in a statement. As of Saturday, between 4,000 and 5,000 birds had been found dead, said Keith Stephens with the commission. ""Shortly after I arrived, there were still birds falling from the sky,"" said commission wildlife officer Robby King in the statement. He said he collected about 65 dead birds. The commission said it flew over the area to gauge the scope of the event, and no birds were found outside of the initial one-mile area. Karen Rowe, an ornithologist for the commission, said the incident is not that unusual and is often caused by a lightning strike or high-altitude hail. A strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day Friday. ""It's important to understand that a sick bird can't fly. So whatever happened to these birds happened very quickly,"" Rowe told CNN Radio on Sunday. ""Something must have caused these birds to flush out of the trees at night, where they're normally just roosting and staying in the treetops ... and then something got them out of the air and caused their death and then they fell to earth,"" Rowe added. Officials also speculated that fireworks shot by New Year's revelers in the area might have caused severe stress in the birds. Rowe said Sunday there was evidence that large fireworks may have played a role. ""Initial examinations of a few of the dead birds showed trauma. Whether or not this trauma was from the force of hitting the ground when they fell or from something that contacted them in the air, we don't know,"" Rowe said.

The Low Pay Commission has recommended the increase to ministers, the largest real terms rise since 2007. Ministers boasted it would take the hourly rate to its highest level in real terms since 2010, but it falls short of the idea it could hit £7 floated by the Chancellor a year ago. The Low Pay Commission set out its recommendation for the main minimum wage rate to rise to £6.70 from October . The Commission recommends the adult rate should rise to £6.70 in October, while it would rise to £5.30  for 18-20-year-olds, £3.87 for 16 and 17-year-olds and £2.80 for apprentices. In an interview in January last year, Mr Osborne suggested it could go higher. ‘If the minimum wage had kept in line with inflation it would be £7,' he said. ‘Because we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’ The 20p rise is the largest real-terms increase in the minimum wage since 2007, and takes its real value three-quarters of the way back to its highest ever level. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This would represent an annual pay rise of £416 for a full time worker on the minimum wage. 'If this recommendation were accepted, the value of the minimum wage would be higher than when we came to office in 2010 and we are now making good progress towards restoring the value it lost during the financial crisis. 'I will now study these recommendations and consult my Cabinet colleagues with a view to announcing the final rates in the next few weeks.' Mr Cable said the Low Pay Commission had to strike a 'delicate balance' between what is fair for workers and what is affordable for employers, without costing jobs.

Brian Thomas Mettenbrink, 20, of Grand Island, Nebraska, was accused of participating in an attack orchestrated by a group that called itself ""Anonymous."" The group led protests against the church in various parts of the country before announcing in January 2008 that it would launch a cyber offensive, said Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Mettenbrink admitted in court that he downloaded software from an ""Anonymous"" message board and used it to launch ""denial of service"" attacks on Scientology Web sites. In such attacks, hackers flood a target site with so much traffic that it is unable to handle the volume and slows to a crawl or crashes altogether. As a result, the site is then unavailable to legitimate users. The group targeted the church after it forced Web sites to yank a leaked video of actor and church member Tom Cruise fervently making the case for Scientology. The video was intended for attendees at a church award ceremony in 2004 where Cruise was being honored. ""We are the authorities on getting people off drugs, we are the authorities on the mind, we are the authorities on improving conditions ... we can rehabilitate criminals,"" Cruise says in the video. In 2008, the video was leaked online and widely ridiculed. The church responded by threatening to sue Web sites unless they removed the clip. ""Anonymous"" then launched its attack. As part of its offensive, the group asked Internet users to not only download the ""denial of service"" software from its message board, but also to place prank phone calls, post proprietary church documents online, and send black pages to church fax machines to waste ink.

A police community support officer is seeking £5,000 compensation from a property firm after she injured her knee while investigating a burglary. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft high wooden fence. The PCSO, who serves with Merseyside Police, said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport. The case will reignite controversy over the millions of pounds in compensation claims – fuelled by no-win, no-fee lawyers – made by police who are injured on duty every year. Last night Miss Harrison’s decision to sue was condemned by her own force. The incident happened in 2009 when she was called to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind, owned by property development firm Lightflask Ltd. Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds and the firm had secured the perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden 3ft fence closing off a gateway at the front  of the site. In court papers, Miss Harrison alleges Lightflask Ltd was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’. The former dog trainer also claims the company had failed to provide or make the wooden fencing safe, failed to properly warn the PCSO about the fencing, or erect warning signs. Miss Harrison also says there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site.

Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, ""but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage."" ""Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,"" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. ""I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,"" he said.

Dr Sentamu added that many such people no longer believed that they could provide a better life for their children than they had enjoyed themselves. 'Formerly, each new generation enjoyed a higher standard of living than the previous one,' he said. 'That was the progress that everybody was taught to expect. It was a source of hope.

An Eton schoolboy was mauled to death by a polar bear while trekking through Norway after his team leaders used paper clips to secure the safety wire. Horatio Chapple, 17, was on a £2,500 adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands when a bear entered their camp, dragged him out of his tent, and killed him. Four others were severely injured before they managed to shoot the bear. Today, it emerged the trip-wire which should have alerted them when the bear approached had been secured by a paper clip. The alert system is designed to set off mines if an animal or intruder crosses the wire. But organisers of the British School Exploring Society trek in August 2011, which hosted 73 children, today admitted one of the wires was faulty and a team leader tried to fix it using the piece of stationery. The revelation comes at the start of an inquest into Horatio's death. A report published to coincide with the first day found the trip wires were inadequate, there should have been a bear watch, and the team should have been trained to use rifles. Sir David Steel, author of the report, blasted the 'inadequate' safety measures advised by Norwegian authorities, ruling that the incident 'was not unforeseeable'. He said teams should not be allowed to trek in the Arctic Circle without proper rifle training. And the team relied on an 'inconsistent' trip-wire system to alert them to the presence of polar bears - but it was inadequate as the warning would be too late. However, Richard Payne, from the BSES, defended the move, claiming it made the wire more effective. He said: 'The whole system is designed to give you an alert for you to wake up and do something about it. It's not a defence, it's not going to kill an intruder, it's going to alert you.' Mr Payne also admitted that the tripwires were not working perfectly and one of the leaders had adapted one","Horatio Chapple, 17, mauled by polar bear as he slept near Arctic Circle .

85c3c11313c63ed171179dd889e9bc16a862be08,"Atlanta (CNN) -- A federal government advisory committee voted Tuesday to recommend that males ages 11 to 21 be vaccinated against the human papilloma virus, which is blamed for thousands of cases of cancer among women and men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said the vaccine series can be started as early as age 9. Twelve members of the committee voted in favor of a recommendation that 11- and 12-year-old boys be vaccinated; one member abstained. In a separate vote involving males age 13 to 21, eight voted in favor; five against, and one abstained. The same recommendation said men ages 22 through 26 may be vaccinated. Much of the debate focused on whether it would be cost-effective to vaccinate boys against HPV. The vaccine is administered over a six-month period in three doses, each of which costs about $120. Dr. S. Michael March, clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California and a member of the group that devised the recommendations, said the cost to vaccinate 11- and 12-year-old boys would be $38 million. ""We have the money, we just have to set the priorities,"" he said. ""If we don't, I don't know who will."" HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States. At least half of sexually active people will get it at some point in their lives. Why vaccinate middle schoolers? Experts say that it's important to immunize people before they become sexually active. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies sexual health, 13% of 15-year-olds have had vaginal sex. By 19, that figure has risen to 70%. The vaccine is less effective after a person is sexually active. Study: Males should get HPV vaccine too .

Dragon, an unmanned spacecraft, successfully came down about 300 miles west of Baja California just after 3:30 p.m. EST, carrying a return load weighing 3,276 pounds, NASA said in a press release. Dragon was expected to be hauled to a port near Los Angeles where some of the cargo would be removed almost immediately, the space agency said, while the rest of the research aboard the rocket will return to SpaceX's facility at McGregor, Texas, for further processing.

The judiciary, he says, has transformed into what the green vegetable means in colloquial language: corruption, nepotism, favoritism. An editorial cartoon in a Cairo daily sums up Egypt's state of affairs: a scribbled mess of spirals. And the presidential election this weekend, once hailed as Egypt's big step toward democracy, is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The runoff vote is taking place after the Supreme Constitutional Court declared the parliament invalid and triggered renewed chaos over the country's leadership. The ruling dealt a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood, which dominated parliament, and was victory for supporters of Shafik, the focus of protesters' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator. Anger festered Friday among those who feared that a hard-won revolution was fast unraveling; that little had changed. Rankled revolutionaries felt left out in the cold on a hot June day.

Jailed: Janet Cooper has been jailed for eight years after masterminding a £1m scam through her position as a town council clerk . A former town council clerk who masterminded a £1million scam from her office has been jailed for eight years. Janet Cooper spent the money on Mediterranean cruises, holidays with her husband in Devon, a £21,000 car and a box for council staff for a match at West Ham United. When the scale of her offending was uncovered she claimed to be blind and said she had no memory of events. The convicted fraudster - once the subject of a Channel 4 documentary - also carried a white stick and wore black glasses. After the hearing at Sheffield Crown Court, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stuart Hall said: 'There is no medical evidence to substantiate her blindness or memory loss.' Cooper was clerk at Brierley Town Council, near Barnsley, for three years. From the beginning of her time at the council she began pocketing a total of £295,000, which she siphoned off from £695,000 public works loans she dishonestly obtained. She used the money to go on holiday, buy a new Volvo and offered £375,000 cash on a four-bedroom bungalow, as well as spending £3,500 for a box at West Ham for council staff to see Barnsley play. She also claimed she was a Channel swimmer and collected sponsorship money. Sentencing her today to eight years in jail Judge Peter Kelson called Cooper 'pathologically dishonest'. She had previously been jailed for 15 months at Basildon Crown Court in 1999 for theft and false accounting and again, in September, 2003 for three years at Leicester for stealing £800,000 from her then employer. On her release she lied on her application form and got her £20,000-a-year job at Brierley Town Council.

Rapist: Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, who was jailed for eight years for attacking a woman who was waiting for a bus home . A Romanian criminal who was deported eight years ago was able to come back to Britain and rape a woman at a bus stop. Homeless Marius Glad Trimbitas, 33, was kicked out of the country in 2005 after an attack on a prostitute. But he returned this year, and within six months carried out a horrific drug-fuelled assault on a woman waiting for a bus  after a night out. The case raises worrying questions about border controls and how a convicted criminal was able to return to Britain. Last night, police launched an appeal for any other potential victims to come forward, warning that they ‘cannot rule out he has done this before’. Trimbitas was deported in 2005 following the conviction for false imprisonment of the prostitute, Woolwich Crown Court heard. He was given a two-year conditional discharge – effectively a slap on the wrist. But it is thought the nature of the offence, and the lack of proper punishment, meant his criminal record was not uploaded to border watch lists, allowing him to return in March this year. Last month, he targeted his 24-year-old victim after she left the Ministry of Sound nightclub near Elephant and Castle in South London. Sentencing him to eight years in jail, Judge Alice Robinson said the attack had a ‘devastating’ impact on the woman. Evidence: A shoe Marius Glad Trimbitas abandoned at the scene after being fought off by passers by who heard his victim's screams. Forensic tests were carried out linking him to the sex attack . She was left with multiple injuries following the assault on October 6 and was saved only when three members of the public heard her cries and fought off the attacker. Simon Shannon, prosecuting, said the victim was out with friends for a birthday celebration and left the nightclub to catch a bus","Marius Glad Trimbitas raped the woman, 24, in a stairwell in south London .

Jessica Padron of Nevada may have found the solution. After securing a prestigious unpaid student internship in the office of Senate leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, she has begun a crowdfunding appeal online. She is asking donors to help pay for her housing, transportation, and food, which she estimates will cost her $6,500 over the four months in the capital. ""If I don't reach my goal,"" she writes in her appeal, ""I will be forced to relinquish this opportunity and miss out on this once in a lifetime chance."" As of Tuesday, online donors had already chipped in enough for half of her costs. Some observers say there is some irony here, given that plenty of lawmakers are pushing to raise the minimum wage, yet don't pay a cent to some of their hardest workers. ""Of everybody in the federal government, only Congress is allowed to use unpaid interns,"" says Eric Glatt, a former unpaid intern who is now an activist with the Fair Pay Campaign. ""They have explicitly written an exemption for themselves into the law."" And it's not just Congress. Private employers in Washington and across the country can offer internships without pay. (Disclosure: CNN pays its interns.) Glatt warns that because only affluent students can afford to work for free, many students will be denied a crucial career experience. ""It is excluding the vast majority of people who cannot afford to work for free, or have their parents afford for their children to work for free,"" he said. ""It also promotes inequality."" Glatt worked for free as an intern on the movie ""Black Swan,"" but later successfully sued the movie studio, claiming that it was not fair that he was paid nothing. ""Employers think that if they slap the word intern on a job then they don't have to pay for it,"" he said. ""Why do people think they can get away with this?"" But at a time of elevated unemployment, and governmen","One intern turns to web to raise money to cover housing, food costs .

059bf8dbd049f854a4c753150a783f9a35d503fb,"(CNN) -- Andy Carroll scored twice, his first goals for Liverpool, to help his club comfortably defeat Manchester City 3-0 in Monday's Premier League encounter at Anfield. City, who needed a victory to move above Chelsea into third place in the table, were blown away by a devastating first half performance from Liverpool, who have consolidated sixth position with this result. Liverpool began brightly and nearly took a seventh-minute lead when Luis Suarez's fine strike was tipped onto the post by City's England goalkeeper Joe Hart. But the visiting defense was struggling to cope with Liverpool's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when Carroll's superbly struck left-footed strike, from just outside the area, swerved past Hart for his first goal since joining the club for a British record transfer fee in January. Liverpool doubled their lead in the 34th minute when City failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots, the ball eventually falling to the feet of Dirk Kuyt who fired through the legs of defender Alexander Kolarov and past Hart. Liverpool made it 3-0 a minute later when Raul Meireles curled in an inviting cross from the left for Carroll to outjump Kolarov and help the ball into the far corner of the net. Liverpool had chances to increase their lead after the break but Hart did well to keep out efforts from Meireles and Kuyt, while Suarez fired wide from an acute angle and Carroll headed over the crossbar from a good position. City's defeat means they lie just three points ahead of Tottenham, who have a game in hand, in the race for the final Champions League place, with the teams still to play each other this season. A bad night for Roberto Mancini's side was made worse with the news that talismanic striker Carlos Tevez is now doubtful for Sunday's FA Cup semifinal against rivals Manchester United at Wembley, after limping off in the first half with a hamstring injury.","Andy Carroll scores his first Liverpool goals in a 3-0 win over Manchester City .

A number of overseas bidders were also interested, but it has been sold to an un-named Scot. The 970-acre island of Wiay: It has been uninhabited for over a century . The . island boasts the cave in which Bonnie Prince Charlie, the leader of . the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, concealed himself for several days while . being sought by British government forces.

The sordid world of the despot who was killed last month in the country's uprising, has been revealed by his manservant of seven years.

Trade ambassador: Prince Andrew had a meal with Gadaffi in 2008 . The aide, now 29, said the royal trade ambassador discussed relations between Libya and Britain and an oil contract. What Andrew was unaware of was Gaddafi's penchant for young women - many of whom were his bodyguards, according to Faisal. He said: There were four or sometimes five women each day. They had just become a habit to Gadaffi. 'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.' Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'. He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.' Faisal claimed that some of the women he bedded suffered so badly 'they went immediately from his bedroom to the hospital' to be treated for internal injuries.

But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive .

""Yeah, well that's something that we have to work on, right? To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers, right? That's exactly right,"" Obama replied.

Resisting the temptation of sweet treats can be difficult at the best of times. But if you work on a cookery programme, surrounded by freshly baked goods, it seems saying ‘no’ is almost impossible. Mel Giedroyc revealed yesterday that she puts on three quarters of a stone every year when she presents the Great British Bake Off. The 45-year-old, who hosts the culinary contest with fellow comic Sue Perkins, admitted gorging on cakes, bread and quiche. And with the aroma of up to 12 tasty offerings being baked at once in the early stages of the competition, it is easy to understand why. Miss Giedroyc said yesterday: ‘I’ve put on a good 11lb every series. The first couple of episodes it’s, “No thank you, not for me”. 'Cut to the semi-final and we’re hoofing up whole quiches.’ In an interview with the Radio Times, she revealed the BBC2 show’s production team had invested in heated belts to prevent judge Mary Berry from getting too cold, but added that the devices helped to ‘keep your stomach in’. The programme, which is in its fourth series, is recorded in a tent in the grounds of Harptree Court, Somerset, and was last year marred by terrible weather, forcing the crew to come up with inventive ways of dealing with the cold. Miss Giedroyc said: ‘When we first started filming, in April, it was freezing so our main concern was to keep Mary Berry warm. She had four thermal layers on and two water bottles down the trousers.

Three men who raided 45 homes across the South East of England and stole £25,000 from elderly people in just six months have been jailed. Patrick Cawley, his brother John Cawley and James Boyle pretended to be police officers to trick their way into the pensioners' homes. In all cases they would flash a fake police warrant card before telling their victims they had arrested someone for a burglary in the area and that they needed to check if anything had been stolen from their homes.

While the elderly person was distracted, one of the men would rifle through their belongings and steal cash and valuables. The con artists targeted vulnerable people in their 80s and 90s who lived alone and often suffered from health issues. Their oldest victims were two men aged 99. Hertfordshire Police were forced to launch Operation Manhunt which was led by a specialist unit set up to investigate distraction burglary and crimes against the elderly. Between January 2012 and July 2012, more than £25,000 was stolen from victims in Hertfordshire, Essex, Warwickshire, London, Surrey, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hampshire.

As a golfer, Michael Phelps is wondering what he's got himself into. ""It's one of the most humbling games I've tried to do in my entire life,"" the American tells CNN. ""I could always pick things up fairly easily, but I don't get how hitting a little object -- a little white ball, that isn't moving -- is so hard. ""Why can't I just hit this in a straight line? Or hook it, or draw it, or fade it -- I can't do it. I'm finally learning how to be able to do all that stuff and do it consistently. But I still do have some pretty bad shots."" Have a quick look online and you'll find Phelps hurling his driver away in disgust after embarrassingly topping his tee shot at the home of golf, St. Andrews in Scotland. ""Throwing clubs, using profanity -- everything comes out,"" Phelps says. But there are some moments of magic, such as when -- as a 26 handicapper -- he sank a monster 150-foot putt at the Dunhill Links pro-am in Scotland last October. However, golf requires both power and precision -- which Phelps, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child, is slowly learning to combine. ""He's one of those players that people would look at and say, 'He has a lot of potential.' What that technically means is that the player is very long and very wild,"" says Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney, who has been tutoring Phelps in the latest series of his television show The Haney Project. ""They never look at someone who hits it a very short distance and say, 'Oh you've got a lot of potential.' They always comment on the potential someone has as based solely on the distance of their hitting.""

Henri de Castries told CNN ""a Greek exit won't solve everything,"" adding the problems in Europe are ""more complex than that."" De Castries, a fan of Greek mythology, believes a Greek exit would be akin to opening a Pandora's box. ""Opening the box is very tempting before and very disastrous afterwards,"" he said. De Castries said there were ""flaws"" in the construction of the euro which have created the cracks. ""It was a case of putting the cart before the horse,"" he said. ""Economic policies were not converging enough and the disciplines were not strong enough to allow for a stable position in the long run."" The worst-case scenario, according to de Castries, would be a disorderly default by Greece leading to its collapse out of the euro. Further, Italy and Spain could suffer bank runs that could exacerbate the bloc's pain. However, such an outcome could be avoided should a moderate party win a majority in the Greek elections, securing the country's future in the eurozone, he said. De Castries points to the Spanish banking crisis as one which must be resolved so Europe can allay concerns about the strength of its firewalls. ""We need to be sure that we don't just have the fire brigade,"" he said, ""but that water is coming out of the pipe. The Spanish case is a good test for that."" AXA, the second-biggest insurer in Europe, has been offloading its investments in Greek debt -- at a 78% write-down -- and no longer buys Italian and Spanish debt, as it seeks to distance itself from the deepening crisis. De Castries said the company's investment portfolio is being kept diverse: ""We have approximately 80% of our assets in bonds, of which half or a little less are in sovereign bonds. The other half is in corporate bonds and 20% are in other asset classes such as equities and real estate,"" he add","Eurozone's economic troubles are too complex to be solved by a Greek exit, says AXA CEO .

6a4506b327b5d820649d0264e4207ce2fef82c51,"(CNN) -- We are losing in Afghanistan, on two fronts. The most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the Taliban well recognizes -- is the American public. And now, most Americans are opposed to the war. For years, Afghanistan was ""the forgotten war,"" and when Americans started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of President Obama's inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight: a corrupt Afghan government, a world-class drug trade, a resurgent Taliban and steadily rising U.S. casualties. Many surely thought: Didn't we win this war eight years ago? Americans, of course, hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat, but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing, which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the Iraq war in 2006. Within a couple of years, Iraq came back from the brink and started to turn around, after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most Americans. Similarly, the American public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in Afghanistan if they saw real progress being made there. And right now, they don't. The second front we're losing is the Afghans themselves, who are the United States' center of gravity in the Afghan war. Eight years into this conflict, America and its NATO allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of Afghans -- are not providing large swaths of the Afghan population with the most basic public good, which is security. It's time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about ""connecting the Afghan people to the government"" -- Afghans have never had, and don't expect much, in the way of services from their government, and it's time now to focus on something much more basic: security.

American football star Mark Duper has been released from jail on bond after allegedly beating up his 17-year-old son in a domestic row. The former Miami Dolphins player faces a felony child abuse charge after assaulting his teenage son and knocking him out during a series of fights at their Florida home. The wide receiver, who starred for the Dolphins from 1982 to 1992, spent a night in jail after his arrest on Wednesday following the assault the day before. Authorities say Duper attacked his son Marcus three times and knocked him out twice. Duper has reportedly admitted there was an altercation but said he was acting in self-defense. It was reported that the argument began with a row over a text Duper's son had sent to an ex-girlfriend. During the row, Duper allegedly asked his son to pick a hat off the floor and punched him in the face when he 'wouldn't listen', according to the arrest report quoted in the Miami Herald. The report claims Duper picked his son up and body-slammed him, knocking him unconscious. The fight is then said to have calmed down before escalating again, with Duper allegedly 'hitting the child in the head and face with his fist'. Later, the fight started up again when the boy is said to have dented his father's car with his bike, and Duper allegedly punched him in the face. The Herald reports the police report: 'Once [the victim] went to the ground on his stomach, Mark climbed on top of [him], grabbed [him] by the neck and began choking.'

Stewart came back to competition Sunday for the first time since his car struck and killed another driver on August 9. The crowd at the Oral-B USA 500 erupted in cheers as Stewart was introduced. But after just 172 of 325 laps at the Atlanta Motor Speedway, his front right tire blew, and Stewart's car smacked the wall on Turn 2. In the end, Kasey Kahne won the race and clinched a spot in the ""Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup"" playoff. Matt Kenseth came in second, and Denny Hamlin finished third. But many thoughts were with Stewart and Kevin Ward Jr., the 20-year-old driver who was killed at the Canandaigua Motorsports Park in New York. Stewart declined to speak to a reporter after Sunday's race. But he spoke to the media briefly Friday about Ward's death.

The Des Moines Register backs Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picks Barack Obama. The Des Moines Register backed Hillary Clinton, while The Boston Globe picked Barack Obama, in excerpts of Sunday's editorials posted on their papers' Web sites Saturday night. The Iowa caucuses are January 3, and New Hampshire's primary follows five days later. The Globe's editorial board dismissed concerns over the Illinois senator's relative lack of Washington experience. ""It is true that all the other Democratic contenders have more conventional resumes, and have spent more time in Washington,"" the board wrote. ""But that exposure has tended to give them a sense of government's constraints. Obama is more open to its possibilities."" But the Register's editorial board -- which noted that Obama ""demonstrates the potential to be a fine president"" -- still gave the edge to the senator from New York, saying it made the nods in both parties' primaries based on competence and readiness to lead. ""When Obama speaks before a crowd, he can be more inspirational than Clinton,"" the board wrote. ""Yet, with his relative inexperience, it's hard to feel as confident he could accomplish the daunting agenda that lies ahead.""

The head of the watchdog monitoring MPs’ expenses is being paid up to £169,000 a year in an ‘off-payroll’ deal allowing her to reap huge tax benefits, it can be revealed. Paula Higson, acting chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), earns the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company. Ipsa, set up in 2009 in the wake of the MPs’ parliamentary expenses scandal, states that its main duty is ‘to serve the interests of the public’. However, it pays Mrs Higson in a deal allowing her to save thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax – while Ipsa cuts its own national insurance payouts. Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander condemned similar ‘off-payroll’ arrangements saying they aided ‘tax avoidance’. Mrs Higson, who runs a private consultancy business, declined an opportunity to outline her tax payments. Ipsa also refused to give more details – even though its own website details staff expenses as small as a a ‘fruit basket’ worth £20. Mrs Higson is already familiar with ‘off-payroll’ deals. After leaving her last salaried job, earning £110,000 a year as chief operating officer at NHS Direct, she switched to working on contract at the same employer for £132,000 a year. The arrangement would have slashed her own national insurance and income tax liability. Miss Higson, who lives in a £1million house in Twickenham, west London, also appears to be continuing to be available for other work  while being paid to monitor MPs’ expenses, with her website fully operational.

The proposed thresholds for taxing health plans will be raised from $23,000 to $24,000 for families and from $8,500 to $8,900 for individuals, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters. Dental and vision benefits won't be counted toward that amount after 2014, he said. Health plans covered by union contracts would not be subject to the 40 percent tax until 2018 -- a transition period union leaders said is comparable to those offered to other private insurers. The threshold for taxing other plans will be adjusted by 1 percent above the annual rate of inflation, and plans involving large numbers of women or the elderly will get breaks as well, Trumka said. The changes will reduce the $150 billion expected to be raised over 10 years by about $60 billion, he said. And union plans would be able to enter the health care exchanges set up under the bill in 2017, he said. The tax on what have been dubbed ""Cadillac"" health care plans is a key feature of the Senate health care bill, but it has drawn opposition from Democrats in the House of Representatives and from unions. President Obama, who has made health care his top priority in Congress, supports the excise tax as a way to contain the rise of health-care costs. Trumka and other top  union officials have held a series of talks at the White House for the past three days as congressional negotiators tried to merge the two bills together. He warned earlier this week that congressional Democratic candidates could risk losing labor's support if the final bill included a tax on high-cost health plans.

We need to move away from dirty, dangerous and deadly energy sources. We are pleased that the White House is now saying it will suspend any new offshore drilling while the explosion and spill are investigated, but there should be no doubt left that drilling will only harm our coasts and the people who live there. Taking a temporary break from offshore drilling is an important step, but it's not enough. We need to stop new offshore drilling for good, now. And then we need an aggressive plan to wean America from dirty fossil fuels in the next two decades. This BP offshore rig that exploded was supposed to be state-of-the-art. We've also been assured again and again that the hundreds of offshore drilling rigs along our beaches are completely safe. Now, we've seen workers tragically killed. We've seen our ocean lit on fire, and now we're watching hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic oil seep toward wetlands and wildlife habitat. This rig's well is leaking 210,000 gallons of crude every day, wiping out aquatic life and smothering the coastal wetlands of Louisiana and Mississippi. As the reeking slick spreads over thousands of square miles of ocean, it rapidly approaches the title of worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, even worse than 1989's Exxon Valdez oil spill. The well is under 5,000 feet of water, and it could take weeks or even months to cap it. This disaster could unfortunately happen at any one of the hundreds of drilling platforms off our coasts, at any moment. It could happen at the drilling sites that the oil industry has proposed opening along the beaches of the Atlantic Coast. Indeed, even before this spill, the oil and gas industry had torn apart the coastal wetlands of the Louisiana Bayou over the years. These drilling operations have caused Louisiana to lose 25 square miles of coastal wetlands,","Gulf spill can have devastating effect on wildlife and shoreline, says Michael Brune .

Christian Isaiah Barnes, 22, of Long Beach, California, was arraigned Thursday, and his bail was set at $500,000, said Farrah Emami, a spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. His next court date is a pretrial hearing on June 7, Emami said. The charge against Barnes carries a maximum prison sentence of six years, the district attorney's office said in a statement. Barnes, an employee at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, allegedly possessed two water bottles containing dry ice -- which can make for a destructive device called a dry ice bomb, the prosecutor's office said. The devices caused small explosions in Disneyland, authorities said. On Tuesday, Barnes was being relieved of his shift at a Disneyland vending cart outside Mickey's Toontown, prosecutors said. When Barnes opened the vending cart, the first water bottle with dry ice exploded, the prosecutor's statement said. Then Barnes allegedly took the second water bottle from the cart and, as he walked to the employee break room through Toontown, allegedly placed it in a trash can, prosecutors said. Barnes allegedly left the area, and a custodian removed the trash bag and placed it on the ground, prosecutors said. The custodian walked away from the bag to clear another trash can, and then the water bottle in the bag exploded, authorities said. Visitors were cleared from Toontown for about two hours as authorities investigated, though the rest of Disneyland remained open.

But for Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin, such reactions to ""The Red Wedding"" are nothing new. Martin has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous Tully-Frey union for more than a decade, ever since he published his Song of Ice and Fire saga's third novel, A Storm of Swords. Below, the author reveals why Robb had to die, gives his reaction to upset readers and spills the scene's horrifying real-life inspiration. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How early in the process of writing the book series did you know you were gonna kill off Robb and Catelyn? George R.R. Martin: I knew it almost from the beginning. Not the first day, but very soon. I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it. The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing Robb] became the next thing I had to do. Since Song of Ice and Fire so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures, should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending? As The Boy recently said on Thrones, ""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."" I've stated numerous times that I anticipate a bittersweet ending. EW: What sort of reactions have you received from readers over the years about the scene? Extreme. Both positive and negative. That was the hardest scene I've ever had to write. It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it. So the ent","George R.R. Martin explains why Robb had to die .

'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.'

Julie Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said.

Convert: Detectives believe fugitive terror suspect wanted for her role in a bomb plot is 7/7 widow Samantha Lewthwaite, pictured as a teenager . Kenyan police say British colleagues have confirmed that a fugitive terror suspect wanted for her role in a bomb plot is 7/7 widow Samantha Lewthwaite. Senior anti-terror police sources in Mombasa yesterday said fingerprints of the woman being sought over an Al Qaeda-linked plan to attack Western tourist resorts had been sent to London. They said Scotland Yard found them to be a match for the wife of suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay. Interviewed on condition of anonymity, a Kenyan police chief said: ‘Samantha Lewthwaite’s fingerprints have been confirmed by detectives we have been working with from the UK. 'This woman is still in the country. She will not escape if she passes through exit points at the border because of her fingerprints. ‘We are confident we are looking for the white widow.' Senior Assistant Commissioner Ambrose Munyasya, head of Mombasa's criminal investigations department, added: 'We are looking for her and if we get to know where she is we will go there. 'I have a strong team of officers in anti-terrorism and they are determined to find her.'

Three G4S detainee custody officers are to be charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of Jimmy Mubenga, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.

Officers Colin Kaler, Terrence Hughes and Stuart Tribelnig will now be charged with manslaughter after earlier inquest found that Mr Mubenga had been 'unlawfully killed' during his deportation. The G4S guards had been tasked with removing Mr Mubenga on a British Airways flight to his native Angola in October 2010. The inquest found Mr Mubenga died of cardio-respiratory collapse, where the heart stops beating and a person stops breathing. Prosecutors decided in July 2012 that no charges should be brought in relation to Mr Mubenga’s death. The case was reconsidered by the CPS after the inquest last year recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

Just last month, the grandmother of two inked a contract with IMG models, the agency that represents Amazons such as Gisele, Kate Moss and Lily Cole. Already this year, Shanghai-born Machado has bagged the front cover of New York Magazine. ""Can you imagine?"" she laughs over the phone from New York. ""You know, I never dreamt this in my whole life!"" She also features in luxury store Barney's Fall ad campaign, styled by former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld, alongside the likes of Naomi Campbell and Crystal Renn. In the past few weeks, she shot a fashion spread for Vogue -- ""Italian ... or Spanish Vogue, I can't remember"" -- with photographer Bruce Weber, which will feature in the coming months. ""(It's) of me -- with all these 20-year-olds he always photographs,"" she says. Not that she's phased -- breaking the mould is nothing new for Machado. Machado had started modelling in Paris in 1954 for Givenchy and Balenciaga and claims to have been the highest paid catwalk model of her time. Her big break came in 1958. Oleg Cassini, who would later become known for designing First Lady Jackie Kennedy's state wardrobe in the 1960s, spotted Machado in Paris and offered her a contract to come to New York to model one of his collections.

Staff at GP practices across the country have been provided with a ‘common sense’ guide to dealing with patients suspected of having Ebola. The step-by-step advice, provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners, has been designed to minimise the risk of the infection spreading in the event it reaches the UK. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the country to expect a 'handful' of cases by Christmas. The guidance, presented in the form of an index card, has been designed to ensure that patients receive the best and fastest care possible whilst protecting practice teams from possible contamination. It is tailored to individual members of GP practice teams, including receptionists and telephone call handlers, practice managers, and duty doctors. Each 'Ebola Action Card' outlines their specific duties and responsibilities if a patient arrives with Ebola-type symptoms or rings the surgery for advice. Patient advice is also included, with recommendations for what to do if they are in a GP practice or at home. Any patient who arrives with a potential case of Ebola will be told to go to an isolation room and will then be assessed by the duty doctor over an internal phone system. If Ebola is a serious possibility, doctors are asked to alert an infectious-disease specialist at the nearest hospital. Compiled by Dr Simon Stockley, a GP from Stockton-On-Tees, the cards provide a practical and common-sense approach to the current crisis, as well as much-needed reassurance for staff and patients in general practice.

In a break with tradition, the Bank is considering ditching the current £5 and £10 notes – which are made from cotton paper –and replacing them with ones made from polymer. The new notes last for more than twice as long, stay cleaner as they are resistant to dirt and moisture and are almost impossible to tear. The Bank of England could introduce polymer £5 and £10 notes (pictured) within three years that can survive a spin in a washing machine . The move will save the Bank more than £100million over a ten-year period because of the new banknote’s improved durability. A typical £5 note currently lasts for two years. The new ones would last for just under six years, it was announced yesterday. Plastic notes were introduced in Australia in 1988 to try and stop counterfeiting. They are due to be issued in New Zealand, Romania, Mexico and Vietnam and current Governor of the Bank of England introduced them in his native Canada. A special one-off plastic £5 was previously issued in Northern Ireland to commemorate the Millennium. The bank says the introduction of plastic notes will save about £10million a year as they will not have to be replaced so often. Polymer £5 notes will measure 125mm by 65mm, smaller than the current note. Supporters of polymer notes say they are more hygienic, harder to tear and more difficult to counterfeit.

Attorney Francis Lawrence, in his opening statement, contended that would be appropriate because the death was an accident. George Huguely currently faces charges including first-degree murder in the death of Yeardley Love, who also was a lacrosse player for the university. University of Virginia law professor Darryl Brown told InSession that involuntary manslaughter in the state carries a maximum 10-year sentence. Huguely has been held for two years. But prosecutors, in their opening statement, said Huguely made an e-mail threat against Love, 22, before her May 2010 death. Prosecutor Warner D. Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely learned Love had allegedly slept with someone else. The defendant wrote, ""I should have killed you"" and Love responded, ""You should have killed me?"" according to Chapman. Huguely responded that the pair should talk, Chapman said. Chapman also told jurors Love's death was slow and painful and that she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. The defense also claims Love was alive when Huguely left. Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."" But defense attorney Lawrence said there was no evidence that Love's head hit a wall. Lawrence said Huguely refused to believe Love was dead when questioned by police.

The row over claims of an establishment cover-up of an alleged paedophile ring took a new turn last night over fresh claims concerning former Commons Speaker George Thomas. When late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens tried to expose public figures he claimed were involved in a Westminster child sex ring in the 1980s, Thomas, who was in the Speaker’s chair at the time, had himself been blackmailed over his homosexuality. Furthermore, The Mail on Sunday has been told of claims that Thomas, who later became Viscount Tonypandy, propositioned young men in the Speaker’s official grace and favour apartment in Parliament. A senior political source said: ‘Thomas had an interest in young men and did not hide it at Westminster.’ In the 1960s, Thomas was a Minister in the Home Office, which is accused of losing over 114 files on alleged child sex cases, including Dickens’S dossier in the 1980s. And he reportedly used his Home Office position to help Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe – who was later acquitted of attempted murder of his gay lover – to cover up an alleged homosexual offence against a minor. The disclosures follow the announcement of official inquiries into claims of a Westminster paedophile ring and a Home Office cover-up. Thomas, who died in 1997, was one of Britain’s best-loved and most influential public figures as Speaker from 1976 to 1983. A Methodist lay preacher, he was a Home Office Minister in Harold Wilson’s Labour Government and joined the Cabinet. As Speaker, he had unrivalled power, including control of Commons debates, security and disciplining MPs and even reading the lesson at Prince Charles’s 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer.

The cook-off in the Forest of Dean, where the animals are accused of damaging trees, attracted wide publicity in its search for the tastiest squirrel snack. Volunteers cooked up quarter-pounders using three minced carcasses each, and one triumphed with a 'cajun melt' surprise - complete with a mozzarella and chutney topping. But they were criticised by vegetarian groups who said grey squirrels were being unfairly maligned, while the RSPCA issued a warning over how the animals were caught. Tasty: It took at least three grey squirrels to make each quarter-pounder at a contest yesterday in the Forest of Dean, prompting complaints by animal rights activists who said it unfairly maligned the little-loved species .

Dozens of would-be chefs submitted a recipe to the Extraordinary Squirrel Burger Challenge, and four finalists served up their version of the dish. Each contestant was handed three 'locally-sourced' squirrel carcasses and added their own flavours to make a quarter pounder. Introduced to Britain in the 19th century, there are now around 100,000 grey squirrels in the Forest of Dean - a population the Forestry Commission claims is 'huge' and 'extremely destructive'. Although the agency does not cull the animals, a spokesman said: 'Grey squirrels do cause considerable damage to the trees through extensive bark stripping.'

Around one in 12 (8 per cent) parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact on the education system since it took power, while almost half (44 per cent) said the impact has been negative. The survey of around 2,000 adults, commissioned by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), indicates that the majority would entrust their child's education to school leaders. Asked who, other than themselves, they trust the most to educate their son or daughter, more than half (59 per cent) of those questioned said head teachers, followed by the local authority (16 per cent) and school governors (13 per cent). Around 6 per cent said they would trust the Secretary of State for Education, a post currently held by Michael Gove, and the same proportion said they would trust an academy chain. The poll also reveals that just 2 per cent believe politicians should be able to prescribe what teachers teach, while a third (35 per cent) said teachers should be able to exercise their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils. The survey comes as the NUT meets for its annual conference in Liverpool. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The fact that only 8 per cent of parents think that the Government has had a positive impact on the education system is very significant.'

It is the gentle Sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones. But fans of Steve Wright’s weekly BBC 2 programme were surprised to discover their romantic messages were not getting through…because it was pre-recorded. Sunday Love Songs has been ruled to have breached the corporation’s guidelines by failing to explain music requests made during the show would not be broadcast the same day. The audience was told to phone in ‘any time’ with romantic song choices and messages, without an explanation the show’s script was finalised three days earlier. It meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point. They also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show, broadcast between 9am and 11am every Sunday. The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience. It upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer Andy Williams had been recorded before his death. The show is recorded on Fridays, but the playlist and script are decided each Thursday, meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show. An answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request.

Mrs Assad, 36, appears to show no misgivings about the regime’s brutal crackdown against dissenters, according to the latest extracts from her private emails. She praises a speech by her husband for conveying a sense of being ‘very strong, no more messing around.’ And she even makes light of the president’s reputation, joking in one exchange with a friend about domestic relations: ‘As for listening - I am the REAL dictator, he has no choice.’ Mrs al-Assad is often portrayed as an unwitting partner to her husband as he conducts a campaign of violence against many of his own people. But the string of emails sent to her husband as well as friends and family members, shows she is, in fact, fully behind his policies.

The Mexico Grand Prix, along with races in New Jersey and South Korea, were included on the provisional calendar for 2014 only to be axed last December. But after last year's false start, the country now looks set to host its first F1 race in 23 years. ""I'm happy to announce we've concluded an agreement to have a race in 2015,"" Ecclestone said, the sport's official website reported. ""Don't miss this race!"" The race will be run at a refurbished 4.421-kilometre Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit in Mexico City. A date has yet to be finalized. Tavo Hellmund, organizer of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas and co-founding partner of the new Mexican Grand Prix said he was ""delighted"" a deal had been reached. ""Ever since Bernie and I began working on a race at Austin, it's been a dream of mine to help Formula One return to Mexico,"" said Hellmund. ""This announcement has therefore been years in the making, but we've gradually been able to assemble all the right pieces. I'm absolutely delighted,"" he added. Force India driver Sergio Perez, one of two Mexican drivers currently on the grid, also hailed the news. ""The return of F1 to our country is a sign that the Mexican state can achieve anything."" Perez wrote on his official website. ""It's a great opportunity to show the world what Mexico is and what we are capable of achieving. We're big and when we have the same tools as our competitors, we are the best in the world."" His compatriot and Sauber driver Esteban Gutierrez also tweeted his approval. Perez was two years old when Britain's Nigel Mansell won the last F1 race in Mexico in 1992. Mexico hosted official F1 racing for eight years between 1963 and 1970.

Azarenka recovered from a set and a break down to win a grueling battle against the Russian third seed after two hours 42 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. The Belarus star had continuously pressed on the Sharapova service in the decider and finally made the breakthrough in the 10th and final game. A first match point was saved by 2006 champion Sharapova, but reigning Australian Open champion Azarenka worked another opening with more determined play to win the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. ""To come back was pretty difficult because Maria is a terrific fighter,"" she told Sky Sports after her win. ""I just had to try to stay focused and when I had the opportunity I had to set it up,"" she added. Azarenka will take on Serena Williams in the final after the American made fast work of her semi-final defeat of Italy's Sara Errani. Williams knocked out underdog Errani in just over one hour, 6-1, 6-2.

After a 'hell of a year', though, he will be taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider - as they have promised - all aspects of England's 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka as part of their scheduled series review, before announcing a 16-man tri-series squad on Saturday. Cook conceded after the margin of his fifth successive one-day international series defeat was confirmed on Tuesday as 5-2, by an 87-run trouncing at Colombo's Premadasa Stadium, that he has no 'divine right' to be selected to lead the team to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. Alastair Cook has endured a horrible series as England captain this winter in Sri Lanka . He can be encouraged, however, by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton's strong hint that - despite his 'miserable' run of form - he is highly likely to retain the gig. For Cook, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - because however England fare down under, with or without him, it is hard to envisage him being back for much more with his sheet-anchor skills in a fast-developing format. Downton also described 2014 as a 'traumatic' 12 months as he reflected on his tenure - which began at the start of January, as England were completing their unexpected whitewash Ashes defeat. One crisis after another followed, the messy aftermath of the Ashes including the sacking of Kevin Pietersen and resignation of coach Andy Flower.

New covert scanners designed to detect radioactive ‘dirty bombs’ and DIY biological weapons are to be introduced in airports disguised as queue barriers. The latest technology - the workings of which remains a secret - look like typical barrier poles which are linked together by roll-out ribbons, used to guide queuing passengers through departure lounges into security. Security controls at airports  have been stepped up in the last decade, with body scanners, such as this one in Germany's Hamburg airport, showing full body images . The scanners are among a display of the latest new security equipment being showcased at the week-long Farnborough International Air Show where organisers have created a realistic mock-up check-in security zone and departure lounge containing the new devices. It is the latest technology – much of it still secret –  developed to help combat the anticipated growing terror threat in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics and beyond. The airport security stand allows the show’s expected quarter of a million visitors  to experience a practical ‘walk-through’ test of new technology from the moment a passenger arrives at check-in to deposit hold luggage before going through security with or without carry-on hand baggage. The radiation detectors are an example of some of the most sophisticated technology to be developed for security purposes. They scan unwary passengers for traces of radioactivity to deter attacks from a ‘dirty bomb’ whose contamination effects could last for years. The radiation detection unit sits near the top of the 3ft high 2.5 inch diameter pole,  just beneath the roll-out extendable belt mechanism. The battery to power it sits in the weighted base. It can send warnings wirelessly via wi-fi to a central control unit. Poles can be linked via wi-fi to track a suspect emitting radiation.

Jerome Cahuzac resigned as minister in March, two months after prosecutors launched a preliminary investigation into suspected tax evasion. It was not until a meeting with the investigating judges on Tuesday that he finally confessed he held the undeclared Swiss bank account, a statement on his blog said. Hollande said Cahuzac had made an ""unforgivable mistake"" that was an insult to the country. ""Yesterday I was both stupefied and angry when I was informed of Jerome Cahuzac's confession to the judges,"" the president said. ""He misled the highest authorities of the country: the head of state, the government, the parliament, and through it the French people as a whole."" Hollande said the full truth will be established. ""The judicial system will play its role to the end and with complete independence,"" he said. ""I hereby affirm that Jerome Cahuzac did not benefit from any protection apart from that of the presumption of innocence. And he left the government at my request from the moment a judicial inquiry started."" Hollande vowed that steps will be taken to bolster the independence of the judiciary, to help it ""fight mercilessly"" against conflicts of interest. He also promised tougher penalties for any elected officials found guilty of fraud or corruption. The claims against Cahuzac, which he repeatedly denied, first came to light in a report by French investigative news website Mediapart in December. The website obtained a recording of a conversation in which Cahuzac supposedly told one of his aides that it worried him to have an account in Switzerland, as UBS was not the most discreet bank. 'Spiral of lies' The scandal dominated the headlines of French newspapers Wednesday.

In an interview on the remote Hebridean island of Jura, where Mr Cameron and his family were on their third summer holiday, he said his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’. It has stopped him from doing his favourite activities including stalking deer – which involves crawling through the heather rifle in hand – and waterskiing. Mr Cameron, who was once credited with killing two stags with one shot, denied that he had given up deer-stalking to placate animal rights groups, calling it ‘probably one of the most defendable’ field sports.

The pair were filmed by hidden night-vision cameras as they clung to the underside of the Dover-bound lorry in Calais. French Channel ports are seeing a surge in asylum seekers trying to make it to the UK, with hundreds of Syrian refugees among those living in squalid camps awaiting their chance. Dicing with death: A night vision camera catches two men attempting to sit on the axle of a lorry to get into the UK . BBC cameras captured the moment the two migrants clambered on to a British lorry under cover of darkness. Migrants often wait for a truck to stop at a junction before climbing underneath. Gangs can be seen on the road leading to the port as lorries approach. This truck was stopped for the migrants’ safety once they were picked up on camera, and French police were called. Its driver Clive Mills said: ‘I would never have known they were on there. I didn’t see them get on. I was looking in the mirror, looking down the road to pull out – it’s just frightening. Something somewhere has to change because you can kill people.’ The men were asked if they realised the danger they were exposing themselves to, and one replied: ‘Yes, but I have to go there. This country is not good to live in, we have to go to England.’ French charity workers say four migrants died in one week earlier this month as they attempted to get to Dover. Calais, which became a magnet for UK-bound refugees in the mid-90s following the war in Kosovo, is again attracting hundreds of migrants who want to cross the Channel. Many are Syrians, some of the estimated 2.1million who have fled fighting in the country. Britain is the preferred destination for many because of its global language and generous benefits.

The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent. The results from the study show that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants, can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent . The study, designed by the Identity Realisation research group at the University of Exeter, in association with Indoor Garden Design, compared people’s effective output across different types of business space. A total of 350 visitors to the horticultural show were asked to measure their creativity, happiness and productivity in four differently designed work environments in a series of 90 experiments. The researchers believe their findings demonstrate that plants are not unnecessary elements of business environments and add weight to other studies, which indicate plants increase psychological comfort and business performance. Previous studies have shown plants improve health, happiness and productivity . Psychologist Dr Craig Knight from the University of Exeter said: ‘We have previously shown that designing your own workspace improves health, happiness and productivity. ‘It was time to go a step further and see whether the principle can also be applied to creativity and indeed whether the very act of designing the workspace can be used effectively. ‘Results at the show demonstrated how creativity can be increased by 45 per cent through improving the psycholog","Scientists from the University of Exeter found plants aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent at work .

The NSA's Section 702 program is still lawful, ""valuable and effective"" in protecting national security, according to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PDF), which noted that ""no evidence of intentional abuse"" was found in the program. However, ""certain aspects of the program's implementation raise privacy concerns,"" according to the report. The large scope of that collection of Americans' information that is supposed to be off-limits -- and uncertainty about the amount of information being gathered -- ""push the program close to the line of constitutional reasonableness."" Despite procedures to minimize collection of domestic and Americans' communications at home and abroad, the government doesn't know precisely how much data and content of Americans' communications is being collected, the report says. The Section 702 program is derived from a section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that was amended in 2008 and gave the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to authorize ""surveillance conducted within the United States but targeting only non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States."" Even though the 702 program isn't aimed at collecting domestic communications or those of Americans abroad, ""incidental"" collection of such data does occur, according to the report.

""This is flexing the muscles."" Tracey estimates that it will cost the campaign ""in the $4 to 5 million range -- at a minimum, $3.5 million."" But, he said, spending the money is a ""no-brainer"" for the Democratic presidential hopeful. ""The strategic brilliance of this for Obama is that he is going to consume about 24 hours of the news cycle,"" Tracey said. ""It boxes [John] McCain in, takes the oxygen out of the room.""

Scientists have warned of a danger to swimmers from the contaminated water, with the so-called KPC enzyme being notoriously difficult to treat. Those who come into contact with the bug can require hospitalization, or in some cases, become carriers of the micro-organism, researchers claim. Scroll down for video . Sailors of the Finn class compete during the first test event for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at Guanabara Bay in August . The Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil's most respected health research institute, said it had discovered bacteria that produce the enzyme in water samples taken from various spots along the Carioca River, Rio de Janeiro. Among the spots is where the river flows into the city's Guanabara Bay, site of the 2016 sailing and wind surfing events. Bacteria with the KPC enzyme are difficult to treat. However, the institute said no instances of infection resulting from the contaminated water have yet been detected. The study's co-ordinator, Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, said: 'The illnesses caused by these micro-organisms are the same as those caused by common bacteria, but they require stronger antibiotics and, sometimes, can require hospitalization. 'Since the super bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism. 'Carriers can take these resistant bacteria back to their own environments and to other people, resulting in a cycle of dissemination,' said the institute, which is affiliated with Brazil's Health Ministry.

f7c348e02c1b84e9a41fe961b4b6660975a8ead9,"(CNN) -- Uganda's parliament adjourned Friday without acting on a bill that would have made engaging in homosexual acts a capital offense, leaving the future of the widely condemned bill uncertain. Though parliament's mandate ends May 18, next week has been reserved for the swearing in of new members. Friday's lack of action on the proposed Anti-Homosexuality Bill means that the issue will not be discussed this session. The bill has been condemned internationally since October 2009, when it was introduced. In addition to proposing the death penalty for certain gay acts, it proposed requiring anyone aware of violations of the bill to report them to the authorities within a day or face criminal sanction, said Human Rights Watch. The bill would have criminalized ""promotion of homosexuality,"" the organization said in a written statement. That would have jeopardized the work of promoters of human rights, it said. The bill or an amended version of it could be presented in the next parliament, which is expected to open in June, Human Rights Watch said. But by then it would have to return to the beginning of the legislative process, the organization said.

1a45dafdf30a5a9ed7adb637f368f2832593d32d,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In what a U.S. military official calls an ""inadvertent encounter,"" a Chinese submarine hit an underwater sonar array being towed by the destroyer USS John McCain on Thursday. The USS John S. McCain, left, anchored at the port of Incheon 40 km west of Seoul, Korea in March 2004. The array was damaged, but the sub and the ship did not collide, the official said. A sonar array is a device towed behind a ship that listens and locates underwater sounds. The incident occurred near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines. The official, who declined to be named because the incident had not been made public, would not say whether the U.S. ship knew the submarine was that close to it. However, the Navy does not believe this was a deliberate incident of Chinese harassment, as it would have been extremely dangerous had the array gotten caught in the submarine's propellers. The Navy has complained in the past that Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, have deliberately tried to disrupt U.S. naval activities in international waters near China. In one widely publicized incident in March, five Chinese vessels maneuvered close enough to the USNS Impeccable to warrant the use of a fire hose by the unarmed American vessel to avoid a collision. The Navy later released video of that incident.","The array was damaged, but the sub and the ship did not collide .

The arrest stemmed from a verbal exchange between Brunswick City Commissioner James Henry Brooks and the family of one of the teen suspects in the slaying during the suspects' first court appearance on Monday. According to his attorney, Brooks told the family of De'Marquise Elkins, 17, that they didn't have to talk to police. ""What he was trying to do, at the point and time that he was approached here at the courthouse, was just tell these folks you have a right to remain silent,"" Brooks' attorney Alan Tucker told reporters Friday. Brooks is a distant relative of the Elkins family, his wife, Alicia Brooks, told CNN. She did not know exactly how they are related. The 59-year-old commissioner was charged with influencing a witness and obstructing law enforcement in an investigation, the Glynn County Sheriff's Office said. Brooks was arrested Thursday, posted $5,000 bond and left jail Friday afternoon. Tucker said his client was not trying to interfere with the investigation.

William Thoms is just like every other little boy. His mother says he 'loves to make noise'. But only two years ago, the three-year-old could barely hear a thing after being born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left. Despite the long battle ahead of him, in which he has to attend weekly speech therapy classes and audiologist appointments, his mother Penelope from Caste Hill in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that her son was lucky. 'We look at his hearing impairment as fortunate because he was born with it and we can help him at a young age,' Mrs Thoms said. William is one of an estimated 3.5 million Australians who have some degree of hearing loss, according to Australian Hearing. Mrs Thoms first found out about her son's problem within the first week of Williams birth when the hospital performed a number of Statewide Infant Screening - Hearing (SWISH) tests that brought back poor results. The three-year-old was fitted with a hearing aid and a cochlear implant before his first birthday . He's now starting to sing along to his favourite songs and is communicating with others perfectly for his age . 'It was a bit of a shock,' Mrs Thoms said, due to having no family history of similar problem. 'We kept wondering ""what kind of life is he going to have?""' But before he turned one, William was fitted with a hearing aid on his left ear, and by the time he was nine-months-old he underwent surgery to receive a cochlear implant. 'With the implant and hearing aid, he can hear like a normal child. The second we had it switched on – 10 days after the operation - we could tell there was a great improvement,' Mrs Thoms said. 'He could hear all these different sounds, like planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch,' His mother, Penelope Thoms, said of","Three-year-old William was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left .

ded442323118f357e558fb44368fbdb1016657f2,"(CNN) -- After moving from New York to Virginia Beach five years ago, Jennifer Herzog started noticing something odd when exiting grocery stores. Her hands and forearms felt hot, looked red and were swollen. After a few errands, she identified the irritant: plastic bags. ""There are some plastic bags that do it, and there are some that don't,"" Herzog said. ""All grocery bags pretty much are bad."" She started noticing other irritants, too: She began to have a similar response to fragrances as she had to plastic bags. Now, when she hugs someone wearing certain perfumes or colognes, her face turns red and swells. Dermatologist Joseph Fowler says skin reactions to fragrances and perfumes are common, but to have a reaction from finished plastic products like plastic bags is extremely rare, though not undocumented. ""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy, usually when they're in the raw material state, and the unfinished products,"" said Fowler, co-author of a medical textbook on dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. ""But because the chemicals in finished products are bound so tightly, it's awfully hard for them to penetrate to the skin and set off the allergy."" Then again, the finished products may not be the real problem. A reaction to plastics like Herzog's may have more to do with residue from the manufacturing process than the plastic itself, says materials science expert Andrew Dent. ""There are additives to make the plastic bags easier to process that manufacturers are putting on the outside surfaces,"" said Dent, vice president of materials research at Material ConneXion. ""That could also be the problem."" Others may react with redness and swelling to plastic bags, but they don't necessarily have an allergy. A condition called dermographic urticaria, in which the skin becomes inflamed from scratching or rubbing, is far more common, Fowler explains. For those with the condition, carrying heavy bags from the grocery store could be enough t","""There are a bunch of chemicals in plastics that can cause an allergy,"" Dr. Joseph Fowler says .

Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible. He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth £1million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes. Labour opponents of the party’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’ Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted. The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to raise £2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and ","It is unusual for tax to be introduced in the course of the financial year .

Bill de Blasio, who surged into the lead among the Democrats running for mayor, has been campaigning for months as a progressive bent on governing in a way that alters or reverses many of Bloomberg's cherished policies -- starting with de Blasio's proposal to raise taxes on households earning $500,000 or more per year. De Blasio, who is married to a black woman, has also made a series of campaign ads that include his biracial teenage children. Bloomberg, in a magazine interview, dismissed de Blasio's campaign as ""class warfare and racist."" Asked to explain the inflammatory charge, Bloomberg said de Blasio is ""making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone watching what he's been doing.

This is a file picture of a black Portuguese millipede . An enormous infestation of millipedes could have caused a crash between  two trains in Western Australia. The crash happened when a train arriving into a station at Clarkson, 25 miles . north of Perth, slammed into a stationary one. It resulted in six passengers being treated for stiff . necks following the crash on Tuesday. But it has since emerged that the crash could have happened after hundreds of Black Portuguese millipedes were found squashed in a slippery mess on the track. 'Millipedes are one of the factors we are going to take into account,' David Hynes, spokesman at the Public Transport Authority of Western Australia, said. 'What happened in previous instances is trains which were travelling at speed have gone over an infestation, crushed them and made the tracks slimy. 'The train loses traction and the train has slipped.' Hynes said. The millipedes are attracted to moist environments and are seen as invasive pests at high population levels. In 2009, thousands of them overran 1.2 miles of track, causing train delays and cancellations near Melbourne in southeast Australia. The black Portuguese millipede is native to Portugal and was accidentally introduced into Australia where it has since become an invasive pest. The millipede has flourished in Australia because of a lack of natural predators. They are most often seen in moist conditions, which creates lots of food. They have also been  known to enter homes. Huge numbers of millipedes were crushed crossing the railway tracks at Tallarook, central Victoria in March 2009, causing train cancellations due to the disturbance of signalling equipment.","A train arriving into a station near Perth crashed into stationary one .

Support: Archbishop Dr Barry Gordon said it made 'no theological sense' to oppose women bishops . Women will be allowed to become bishops in Wales’ Anglican churches following a landmark vote that will surely put pressure on the Church of England to follow suit. Members . of the Church in Wales’ 144-strong governing body voted through the . proposals at a meeting in Lampeter, near Cerdigan in west Wales, earlier today. Supporters and women’s rights groups called the decision long overdue, arguing the exclusion of women from the top roles made the church less relevant in modern society. Wales has now joined Scotland and Northern Ireland in opening their doors to the ordination of women bishops, leaving just the Church of England opposed to the idea. The issue was hotly debated at the Church of Wales’ governing body meeting in the University of St David. The vote needed a two thirds majority from three of the Church in Wales’ 'houses' - Laity, Clergy and Bishops. Laity voted 57 for and 14 against, with Clergy backing the move 37 to 10. Bishops’ vote was unanimously in favour of the plan. Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said it made 'no theological sense' to continue opposing the ordination of women as bishops when the church already ordained them as deacons and priests. It is the second time in five years it had faced the issue. A previous proposal was defeated in 2008 by just three votes. The Bill was proposed by the six diocesan bishops of the Church in Wales. Canon Patrick Thomas of Christ Church, Carmarthen, said: 'I’m happy with Bishop Wyn but would be just as happy with Bishop Wynona.' Nigel King, stewardship officer for the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon, added: 'Do we really care whether the bishop has external or internal plumbing?'

The move comes days after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the Treasury statement said Monday. The IAEA's governors approved a resolution last week expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" ""The IAEA's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""Today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with Iranian banks."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will ""outline new steps the United States is taking to increase pressure on Iran"" on Monday afternoon in Washington, the State Department said. The United States will name Iran, as well as its central bank, as a ""primary money-laundering concern"" but will not place sanctions directly on the central bank, a senior Treasury Department official told CNN. The Obama administration plans to impose fresh sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry, diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said Friday. U.S. sanctions already prohibit American companies from doing business with Iran.

The product is called iViTi ON and uses technology invented by Litonics Ltd in Knighton, Powys, Wales. ‘iViTi ON automatic switching has the single aim of ensuring that users are not left in the dark should the electricity supply fail,’ the company writes on their website.

After a rush to close coal-fired power stations to meet green targets, a deep freeze means mothballed oil and gas power stations could have to be restarted and factories paid to shut down to preserve power. Business leaders warned that for too long, the UK has failed to plan properly to keep the lights on, as the National Grid revealed the average gap between supply and demand will be just 4.1 per cent - the narrowest in eight years. The National Grid report said the country will be eating into its most basic reserve power if there is extreme weather.

The BBC has called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives, it emerged last night. The corporation’s director general Tony Hall told staff in an internal email he has ordered KPMG to look at deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the severance pay scandal. The National Audit Office is investigating the files of 90 senior managers handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached contractual limits.

He resigned in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about doctored footage of the Queen.

And while a perfect game -- defined as one in which the pitcher allows no hits and no walks -- is a rare occurrence for the sport, what makes this 13-year-old pitcher's feat even more impressive is that she did it against the boys. Yes, she. Chelsea Baker, once a student of former major league pitcher Joe Niekro, last week donated the jersey she wore to pitch one of those special games to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The jersey will be part of an exhibit dedicated to the importance of women in the sport, according to the museum. Chelsea, who until recently honed her pitching arm in Plant City, Florida's Little League program, told CNN Sunday that she feels ""really honored and blessed"" to be recognized on a national level at such an early age. In addition to her Hall of Fame achievement, Chelsea was also recently featured on ESPN's ""E:60"" series. Chelsea, who says she has been pitching since she was 7 years old, boasts a fastball in the mid-60s (miles per hour) and a baffling knuckleball that has been known to make her male opponents shed a tear. ""Yeah, when I strike them out with the knuckleball, sometimes they'll throw their helmets and start crying,"" she laughs. ""It's just really funny to watch."" It's a pitch that was perfected with help from Niekro, who was her team's batting pitcher before his death in 2006. ""He would always throw it to us and I could never hit it, and so I'd always beg him to teach it to me and finally one day he just taught it to me,"" she says. The knuckleball has helped propel Chelsea through four seasons without a loss with her Brandon Farms team -- and her batting average isn't bad either, hitting over .600 this season, though she notes ""I like pitching more than batting.""

A woman struck by a syndrome that deformed her face has now been the victim of botched surgery - which means she will never smile again. Carly Swann, 32, was just 14 when her face became paralysed, meaning she cannot raise a full smile or even blink on the right side. The mother-of-two suffers from a condition called cholesteatoma - an abnormal collection of skin cells inside the ear which apart from . hearing loss, can also lead to facial nerve damage resulting in a . weakness to half the face. For half her life, Ms Swann, from Sheffield, . avoided looking in mirrors because she was ‘too . repulsed’ by her own reflection. In total, she has had 16 operations for her condition. In 2007, the mother-of-two had an operation at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, using muscle taken from her left thigh and put into her cheek. The operation was a success and she regained control and movement in her face, allowing her to smile again - and for two years she lived a ‘happy’ life. But when an infection meant her face would need to be operated on again, the outcome left her devastated. Surgeons at The Royal Hallamshire Hospital interfered with the muscle holding the sling to correct her smile  - which caused it to disappear. Ms Swann later discovered that her operation notes from 2007 were not requested from the hospital who had corrected her smile and restored her confidence. She was awarded a substantial sum in compensation from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after they admitted clinical negligence. Ms Swann, who works as a PA, said: 'It was the worst point in my entire life when I saw what they had done - my face was ruined. 'They had completely destroyed my chances of smiling again.

Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, has been held in the western mountain city of Zintan by the militiamen who captured him in 2011. The group has refused to hand him over to the central government, citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital. The trial was held under tight security with roads leading to Tripoli's al-Hadba prison blocked off by security forces and gunmen positioned on the building's rooftop. The judge read the charges against the defendants, which included the killing of protesters -- a crime punishable by a death sentence -- and other alleged crimes to try and suppress the 2011 uprising. Among the 23 defendants present at the hearing were Abdullah al-Senussi, the elder Gadhafi's brother-in-law and former spy chief, former Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and the regime's head of foreign intelligence, Buzeid Durda. Eight other defendants held in the city of Misrata also appeared via video link at the trial. After more than two years in prison, Senussi, who was extradited from Mauritania, appeared frail and had lost weight. Gadhafi seemed relaxed and frequently smiled during the two-hour proceeding. In response to the judge's question on whether he had a lawyer, Gadhafi responded twice, saying, ""I have God"". He later said he did not have a lawyer, and the court ordered one to be appointed for him. The International Criminal Court in the Hague indicted Gadhafi and Senussi on war crimes, but Libya refused to hand them over, arguing they had to face justice in their own country. Although the international court granted Libya the right to try Senussi last year, his ICC-appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling.

Doctors at the university will begin studies in human beings later this year. Hopes are high, even though many drugs that work in mice do not work in humans. ""It is a tour de force and offers a new and potentially exciting opening for developments of new anti-obesity drugs -- something which is badly needed,"" says Dr. George Bray, chief of the Division of Clinical Obesity and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. In the study at the University of Michigan, researchers gave mice a high-fat diet, and they became obese. They then injected the animals with a drug called amlexanox, which has been on the market for more than 15 years to treat canker sores. The mice lost weight, even though they kept eating the same number of calories. When they were taken off the drug, the mice gained all the weight back. If amlexanox works in humans -- and that's a big if -- Bray said it could become like the story of Viagra, which was originally developed to treat one condition, chest pain, but serendipitously was later found to treat a different condition, erectile dysfunction. ""It could well be that what works for one disease will turn out to work for another, even though that wasn't the original intent,"" he said. The researchers screened several drugs and found that amlexanox, used in an ointment to treat canker sores, changed the action of genes that control metabolism. When injected in mice, the drug worked by increasing metabolism, not by suppressing appetite.

This so-called virgin myth, perpetuated by Zimbabwe's traditional healers, has led to the rape of hundreds of girls, according to UNICEF. Some of those victims are too young to walk, much less protect themselves. Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country's young girls from sexual abuse. And she's witnessed some of the worst cases of the myth in action. ""The youngest girl I ever came across was a day-old baby who was raped,"" said Makoni, 37. Through her Girl Child Network (GCN), Makoni has helped rescue 35,000 girls from abuse -- including Hope; thousands more have found an empowering community and a public forum in which to speak out. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""Ten girls per day report rape cases,"" she said. ""It means if we keep quiet, at least 3,600 girls per year may just be contracting HIV and AIDS."" Makoni's own tragic experiences fuel her fierce determination. ""I was raped when I was 6 years old,"" she recalled. Her attacker was a local shopkeeper. Makoni said her mother would not allow her to report the abuse. ""She said, 'Shh, we don't say that in public,' "" Makoni remembered. ""I had no shoulder to cry on."" Three years later, she witnessed her father murder her mother. In that moment, Makoni said she realized the potentially deadly consequence of a woman's silence.

Barney Frank said Wednesday, announcing a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams, almost a quarter-pound, of the substance. Rep. Barney Frank's bill would radically curb federal penalties for personal marijuana use. Current laws targeting marijuana users place undue burdens on law enforcement resources, punish ill Americans whose doctors have prescribed the substance and unfairly affect African-Americans, said Frank, flanked by legislators and representatives from advocacy groups. ""The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government's business,"" Frank said on Capitol Hill. ""I don't think it is the government's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time."" The Massachusetts Democrat and his supporters emphasized that only the use -- and not the abuse -- of marijuana would be decriminalized if the resolution resulted in legislation.  Watch Frank lay out the proposal » . The Drug Enforcement Administration says people charged with simple possession are rarely incarcerated. The agency and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy have long opposed marijuana legalization, for medical purposes or otherwise.

""Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine and it is not safe,"" the DEA states on its Web site. ""Legalization of marijuana, no matter how it begins, will come at the expense of our children and public safety. It will create dependency and treatment issues, and open the door to use of other drugs, impaired health, delinquent behavior, and drugged drivers.""

""It definitely started out a little rough for me, but I'm glad I was able to turn it around and start playing some good tennis in the second and third sets,"" 20-year-old Stephens told the WTA's official website. ""At the start of the second set I was just going to start going for my shots a little more and hoped they would just go in. I'm glad I started hitting and finding a rhythm. That kind of helped me out for the rest of the match. ""Obviously when you're playing someone who's No.3 in the world, you know they're No.3 for a reason and they're going to be tough. You've got to go out and play your hardest. But when you think about it, you're like, 'Okay, I'm playing Sharapova.' Like, you've got to get your mind right."" The match was Sharapova's first since hiring U.S. legend Jimmy Connors as her coach and, while quick to credit Stephens, she was disappointed she was unable to continue the form she showed in the match's opening set. ""I didn't continue what I was doing well for the first set and a half, and that hurt me,"" explained the 26-year-old. ""I stopped being patient. I started making a lot more errors, especially off the first ball. Just errors I shouldn't make. ""Obviously I haven't played in a long time, but I've got to be ready from the first match.

Doctors face an inquiry into the death of tycoon Scot Young after it emerged he left an NHS mental health facility just hours before he fell 60ft from a flat. Mr Young, 52, who was involved in one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases, landed on metal railings outside a £3million apartment earlier this month. It has emerged that he had admitted himself to the NHS Gordon Hospital in central London on December 5. The facility specialises in treating the most severe mental health problems and its website says it only admits patients who are ‘in an acute phase of a serious mental illness’. But Mr Young walked out on December 8 and was dead hours later, after showing up at his ex-girlfriend’s apartment and warning he was going to jump. Health workers were obliged to contact him within 24 hours for a check-up, but he was dead by the time they called. Doctors were accused of failing Mr Young, who had twice previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was taking prescription medication for bipolar disorder. His family is furious that he was allowed to leave the facility when he was apparently acting ‘manic’ and ‘crazy’. But as Mr Young had not been sectioned, hospital staff could not force him to stay.

A man hospitalized in April is infected with the novel coronavirus, France's Health Ministry said Thursday. The NCoV virus was recently found for the first time in humans and scattered cases have occurred across parts of the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia. It has proved deadly in more than half of the confirmed cases so far, according to the World Health Organization. Of 31 people with confirmed infections, at least 18 have died. But infectious disease specialists believe the virus is very difficult to catch. The newly infected man is the first confirmed infection in France, the Health Ministry said. He had recently returned from travel to the United Arab Emirates, which is on the Arabian Peninsula. Identifying the source of the man's ailment took time, the ministry said. France's Pasteur Institute confirmed the case Wednesday. The Health Ministry is seeking anyone who may have had contact with the patient. NCoV, like some common colds, is also caused by a coronavirus. And like a cold, it attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said. But symptoms are severe and can lead to pneumonia and even kidney failure. ""Once it gets you, it's a very serious infection,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. NCoV has also been compared to related coronavirus, the one that causes SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which appears to have been contained in 2004, according to the CDC. Although its discovery in humans is new, NCoV would seem potentially deadlier, when contracted, than SARS.

Quintessentially British pottery designer Emma Bridgewater has revealed how in her darkest moments - following the horse-riding accident that left her mother severely brain-damaged aged 53 - she would go to the cinema alone and drink neat vodka to numb the pain. The mother-of-four, whose pretty polka-dot teapots and plates speckled with little pink hearts are stocked in middle class kitchens all over the country, says she used the fiction of film and theatre as an escape. Speaking in a new book by ad-man Charles Vallance titled The Branded Gentry: How A New Era of Entrepreneurs Made Their Names, Bridgewater - who founded her eponymous earthenware company based in Stoke-on-Trent in 1985, and in 2011 turned over £15m of profit -says: 'I've built a switch-off mechanism, otherwise I'm not sure I'd have survived. 'I can remember the horror of sleepless nights I've had. Sometimes, you have to sort of use an escape like fiction; theatre is very good; cinema is brilliant; cinema and alcohol are very, very effective. 'I can remember going to see Gosford Park, at a very hard time, sitting in the front row having had two large vodkas, feeling absolutely no pain at all.' Bridgewater, 51, who was one of eight siblings and now has Elizabeth, Kitty, Margaret and Michael with designer husband Matthew Rice, continues: 'I think a tragedy like this fires you up. I don't exactly understand why, but in some strange, probably quite simple way, what you're doing in your career, you're doing it for her. 'It's often unfocused and there can be anger, but there's a real longing to put it right - even though you can't really.'

Photographer Max Alexander had shed light on some of the shapes of substances created by a technique known as x-ray crystallography. Pictured here is the rapid crystallisation of a cancer drug . The method describes a process that allows scientists to find the shape of molecules and then learn more about their atomic arrangement. It was pioneered in the early 20th century when scientists discovered that X-rays could be used to 'see' the structure of matter in a non-intrusive way. When X-rays hit a protein crystal they are scattered by individual atoms, and the way they are diffracted depends on the how the atoms in the molecule are arranged. Using sophisticated mathematical techniques, an X-ray diffraction pattern can be used to work out the relative positions of different atoms in a molecule.

Around the time of the attack, the group released a video boasting that it was growing stronger. Boko Haram translates loosely to ""western education is forbidden/sinful."" It holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a state in northern Nigeria under Islamic law. Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of extrajudicial killings in its fight against the militant group.

The new episode -- ""A Long March to Freedom"" -- focuses on the Freedom Summer of 1964 for a very notable reason. This week marks the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer -- the tumultuous period in our history when three young workers were kidnapped and murdered in Mississippi while attempting to register people to vote. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner shall never be forgotten. The three youths were civil rights workers in Mississippi who had taken their summer to help eligible citizens to register to vote, a right that state and so many others down South had denied for more than one hundred years. As the men drove through Philadelphia, Mississippi, they got a flat tire. The town's deputy sheriff put on his patrol car's red light and pulled them over. He called for two highway patrolmen. Forty-four days later, the FBI found their bodies in an earthen dam. Goodman and Schwerner, white students from the North, were shot through the chest. Chaney, an African-American student from Mississippi, was beaten to death. Though 18 men were indicted on federal conspiracy charges and were likely present at the killings, seven were convicted. The longest sentence served was just six years. Those three men knew the risks they were taking, one reason why they were making haste through Mississippi's countryside and small towns. They had no desire to be martyrs. Yet, they were killed by racists who sought to stop their campaign to secure each Mississippian the right to vote. It was their deaths, along with hundreds of actions by courageous civil rights workers during the Freedom Summer of 1964, that mobilized the Congress to end the filibuster and approve the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and gave much needed momentum to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

bac88375c4b51aa414d918d2fb4aebe5825c42f1,"(CNN) -- Italian teenager Federico Macheda enjoyed a remarkable debut to English football as he curled home an injury-time winner that sent Manchester United back to the top of the Premier League with a thrilling 3-2 home win over Aston Villa. Macheda receives a hug from manager Sir Alex Ferguson after scoring Manchester United's last-gasp winner. It seemed United would have to settle for a point after Cristiano Ronaldo's double had only proved enough to keep United level against a Villa side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor. But 17-year-old substitute Macheda, a former member of the Lazio academy who arrived at Old Trafford in 2007, was to have the last word. Who is Federico Macheda? At exactly the same moment as Yossi Benayoun struck for Liverpool at Fulham on Saturday, Macheda turned onto Ryan Giggs' low pass before unleashing a stunning shot that curled past Brad Friedel and sent Old Trafford into ecstasy. United, missing a host of players including Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, started poorly against an out-of-form Villa side who had gone eight matches without victory. However, a stunning piece of skill from Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 14th- minute lead. James Milner and Friedel got themselves into a muddle, forcing the Villa keeper to handle a back pass. The resulting free-kick saw Ryan Giggs brush the ball to Ronaldo, who sent a fierce shot over the wall and into the roof of Friedel's net in a flash. Villa were not to be denied and they drew level when Gareth Barry wriggled his way into space by the touchline and Carew crept between Gary Neville and John O'Shea to steer a deft header into the bottom corner of the net. The visitors then took a deserved lead on the hour mark when Ronaldo gifted possession to Stiliyan Petrov, who swept upfield unopposed. He found Carew, whose perfect cross was headed home by Agbonlahor. The goal stung United into life and they levelled with 13 minutes ","Federico Macheda scores an injury-time winner as Manchester defeat Villa 3-2 .

When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. Now, however, law enforcers in two American states are using crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervising them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system uses a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers, and will be extended to Washington D.C. soon. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Prof. Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future.  It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. He told ABC News that currently parole officers are using their own judgment to decide what level of supervision each parolee should have, based on their criminal record. His software, he said, replaces that 'ad-hoc' decision making, and should identify eight future murderers out of 100. He said: 'People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future, but what really matters is what that person did as a young individual. 'If they committed armed robbery at age 14, that's a good predictor. 'If they committed the same crime at age 30, that doesn't predict very much.' Prof. Berk's researchers used the details of more than 60,000 crimes then wrote an algorithm to find the people behind the crimes who were more likely to commit murder when they were out of prison.

In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. Recently, 12 Brazilian states began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert their civil unions into marriages. However, since the Supreme Court does not carry legislative powers, it was up to each notary to officiate at their discretion, and many refused, citing the lack of law. Same sex marriage: Who will legalize next? Joaquim Barbosa, president of the Council of Justice, said in the decision that notaries cannot continue to refuse to ""perform a civil wedding or the conversion of a stable civil union into a marriage between persons of the same sex."" Barbosa, who also presides over the Supreme Court, says the resolution merely follows the transformation of society. ""Our society goes through many changes, and the National Council of Justice cannot be indifferent to them,"" he said. Civil unions between same-sex couples have been recognized in Brazil since 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to ""stable unions"" of heterosexual couples would apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. People in same-sex unions are also allowed to extend health benefits to their partners, following the same rules applied to heterosexual couples. Brazilian lawmakers have debated same-sex marriage, but in most cases, the bills introduced have not progressed through Congress. Brazilian neighbors Uruguay and Argentina are the only other two countries in Latin America that have laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.","In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions, including same-sex ones .

She was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she couldn't get up during the night. When this treatment failed, she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy. This treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries. Miss Walker said: 'I had one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor. The therapist focused on examining my stress levels and revisiting the memories of self-harming while I was awake when I was younger. 'It scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because I had no conscious outlet for the stress I was feeling. 'After the sessions with the therapist and the counsellor, I was much more relaxed. At first, I was still harming myself in my sleep, but the injuries became less bad. 'It stopped completely after me and my current boyfriend, Matt, became close again. We were very close friends when I was 16, but I lost contact with him between the ages of 19 and 21. 'It hurt to be apart from him. But since I've been in my current job, and in a stable relationship, I've never felt better.'

They've counted calories, carbs, Weight Watchers points, their heart rate, steps and miles. Now a new smart eating utensil called the HapiFork will help them count bites during meals, and maybe shame them into eating slower and potentially losing weight. Technology has made it easier to track the minutiae of everyday life, with smartphones, pedometers and small sensors that can fit in wearable devices such as wrist bands. The self-tracking hobby has blossomed into the quantified-self movement, which reaches far beyond the health conscious. People are tracking their sleep patterns, heart rate, mood, air quality and work habits, often in a bid to analyze enough data to correct problems with their health or lifestyle. ""Whatever we can measure, we can improve,"" said Fabrice Boutain, CEO and founder of HapiLabs. In the case of the HapiFork, what can be improved is how fast people eat. It takes 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it is full and that it's time to stop eating, putting speedy eaters at risk for being overeaters. The HapiFork team says there are many potential health benefits to eating slower, including decreasing acid reflux, obesity and diabetes. The $99 fork first gained attention during the Consumer Electronics Show in January and will be on the market by the end of the year. How it works . The fork can be used to passively track eating habits and automatically sync that information, including duration of meals and frequency of forkfuls, with a smartphone. The HapiFork mobile app will also include a coaching program and tools to connect with friends and family. The device can also be set up for behavior modification, vibrating any time the diner is eating too quickly as a gentle reminder to slow down. By default it is set to allow a bite every 10 seconds, though the exact time is customizable. When the metal tines of the HapiFork touch the mouth, a circ","The HapiFork tracks how quickly you eat, vibrating if your bites are less than 10 seconds apart .
The company behind the smart fork has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $100,000 .

449f52d124565dc1917707f9ec145c7c32ad9583,"Denver (CNN) -- A Colorado advocacy group is spending thousands of dollars to convince people that smoking pot is safer than drinking alcohol. It's an attempt by the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol to rally support for a vote in November that would legalize the drug for recreational use. Colorado legalized marijuana for medical use in 2000. Last Friday, the group aired an advertisement on a local Denver channel during daytime programming encouraging people to ""start your conversation about marijuana."" The 30-second spot features a young woman typing a message to her mother on her laptop, explaining that after spending her college years drinking heavily, she now prefers marijuana because ""it's less harmful ... I don't get hung-over and honestly I feel safer around marijuana users."" The marketing campaign aims to ""break down the stereotype about who the typical marijuana user is,"" explained the campaign's co-director, Mason Tvert. ""Most of them are professional, hard-working people,"" he said. The TV ad, which aired only on Friday, cost about $2,000, according to Tvert. It may run again, depending on fund-raising efforts, he said. Last month, the campaign spent about $4,500 on a billboard near Denver's (Sports Authority Field at) Mile High stadium -- purposely adjacent to the Mile High Liquors store -- to deliver a similar message, Tvert said. The billboard also features a woman, this one in her 50s, standing with her arms crossed next to the message: ""For many reasons, I prefer ... marijuana over alcohol. Does that make me a bad person?"" Watch the TV ad . By attempting to change ""stereotypes"" about marijuana users, the campaign hopes to make Colorado the first state to legalize recreational marijuana use. ""The goal is the choice -- to make sure adults have the choice to use a less harmful substance than alcohol,"" Tvert said.

Peer, who had just finished playing in the Pattaya Open in Thailand, where she reached the semifinal, said she is ""very, very disappointed"" to have been denied the opportunity to play in Dubai. ""They really stopped my momentum because now I'm not going to play for two weeks and because they waited for the last minute I couldn't go to another tournament either,"" Peer said from Tel Aviv.

ab75c2dff95a835781b3fa114a3b5646c8b69147,"(CNN) -- It was supposed to have been over in a few days. World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless. But that's not the way things happened. As NATO's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark, analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions, including success based solely on surgical airstrikes, for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months. ""It's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this,"" said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security, a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world. The basic problem, McGregor said, stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition. Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia, Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi. Western powers believed that with a little help, Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule. But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges. This wasn't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support. ""This revolt never really had the strength to succeed,"" McGregor said. ""There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up. But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first. If you're just going to run out on the streets, the results will be predictable."" Four months on, the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves, McGregor said. They are out of fuel, oil production has shut down, and they have few available resources. They will soon face even shortages of food and water, McGregor said. President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces. There is debate, too, in Europe over the expensive air campaign.

'FSU became a sexually hostile environment where her rapist roamed free and could turn up at any moment, where she became the target of death threats and vilification campaigns,' the lawsuit says, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Winston, a 21-year-old junior, says the 2012 sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and has denied that he raped her. The prosecuting attorney's office said there was not enough evidence to charge him. And last month a Florida State University ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing. Jameis Winston is expected to be picked early in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft - despite the specter of rape allegations hanging over him . Winston has said that the sex with his rape accuser was consensual. He was never charged with a crime and last month he was cleared of wrongdoing by an investigative panel at FSU . The rape allegations - along with off-the-field antics, including a shoplifting citation - are likely to keep Winston from being the no. 1 prospect in the NFL draft. But, with numerous teams desperate for a talented quarterback, he's still expected to be drafted early in the first round. 'After weighing this decision with my family and friends, I have decided to declare for the 2015 NFL draft and forgo my remaining eligibility at Florida State. I reached this very difficult decision after careful consideration and long thought, realizing how difficult it would be to say goodbye to my family at Florida State,' Winston said in a statement on Wednesday.

Confused council officials stormed a village pub thinking they were busting an illegal late-night gig - only to realise 4AM was the name of the band, not the starting time. Three licensing officers and two police officers raided The Feathers, in the sleepy Surrey village of Laleham, after spotting an advert promising ‘music from 4am’. The name of the band - billed as a two-piece soul funk combo - led bungling council inspectors to assume the pub gig would kick off at 4am, and they lay in wait to raid the pub before striking just after 10pm. 'Very confused': John Adams (left) and Joe Becket were baffled after council officials mistook their band name, 4AM, for a late-night stage time . Kate Dillon, landlady of The Feathers, said she was ‘amazed’ at the ‘sting’ operation - saying it was unbelievable that two police officers were called in to back up the three licensing staff from Spelthorne Borough Council. She said it was like ‘using a sledgehammer to crack a nut’, adding: 'They turned up with two police officers and three council officers. 'I was outside at the time collecting glasses (and) I came into the pub and said: ""What on earth is this all about?"". 'They wanted to know if there was going to be music on until 4am and I was absolutely speechless for the first time in my life. 'I’m too old to stay up that late.' The duo, named 4am after a song by jazz legend Herbie Hancock, is made up of singer John Adams and drummer Joe Becket. Mr Adams said everyone was ‘very confused’ about the raid, adding: 'This has never happened to us before.

Now, with yet another huge stride having just been taken on her impressively rapid and upward career trajectory, the 21-year-old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets. The unwelcome blip of failing to make the 800 metres final at the World Indoor Championships in March seemed to have been well and truly forgotten earlier this week as Muir surveyed Hampden and the multi-coloured arena which will provide the stage for two landmark athletics meetings that could potentially send this modest shooting star into a different stratosphere. Ready to rumble: Laura Muir has toughened up for the Commonwealth Games . One, of course, is the Commonwealth Games, where she plans to contest both the 800m and 1500m. The other, which comes first, is the Diamond League meeting which will pitch up at the home of Scottish football on July 11 and 12. Muir – who clearly can’t wait to try out the revolutionary track - will run the 800m on that occasion and, in what will be a fascinating sub plot, so too will her compatriot Lynsey Sharp. The fact that both are finding form at just the right time means a Scottish head-to-head for honours is considerably more than just a remote a possibility. On Sunday, In the Dutch city of Hengelo, Muir took part in her first race of the outdoor season and promptly ran a 1500m personal best time of 4:02.91. At the same meeting Sharp, who has not had her injury troubles to seek, was also breaking new ground for herself – a time of 2:00:09 providing an 800m personal best and putting the European champion second in the Commonwealth rankings. Moving up a rung on the athletic ladder has to be hard-earned though and, even if it might not necessarily be part of her nature away from competition, Muir insists she is more than happy to fight her corner now when it comes to the dark arts of racing. ‘I remember during what wa","Muir ready to give as good as she gets in Glasgow this summer .

'Day of reckoning': Gordon Brown has warned that Italy and France may need bailouts as the Euro debt crisis spreads . France and Italy may need massive bailouts, as the euro approaches its 'day of reckoning', Gordon Brown warned last night. The former Prime Minister, who played a key role in co-ordinating global action in response to the Credit Crunch, accused European leaders of failing to rise to the challenge of the crisis - and warned that Europe could be facing a 'lost decade'. In a hard-hitting article for the Reuters news agency, Mr Brown said the European economy was in a 'downward spiral that shows no sign of ending'. He said Greece was likely to suffer a 'chaotic' exit from the euro regardless of the result of Sunday's elections, with a string of other countries likely to suffer serious financial contagion as a result. He warned that Europe's banks may need a further £400 billion in emergency funding. Writing on the eve of the G20 Summit in Mexico, Mr Brown urged world leaders to bring forward radical proposals to stave off the threat of collapse. 'The standard, but often empty, language of summit communiqués will simply not do when the euro area is finally approaching its own day of reckoning,' he said. 'Whichever way the Greeks vote in Sunday's election, a chaotic exit from the euro is becoming more likely - its tax revenues are collapsing, not rising as promised. 'Unable to regain access to markets, Portugal and Ireland will soon have to ask for their second IMF programmes (bailouts).

""Our conversations in Yemen have led us to the conclusion that the attack was directed against our embassy,"" according to a statement released Tuesday evening. ""Since this is an ongoing investigation, we are not going to talk about the specifics of the case."" Earlier, a source with knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Tuesday's mortar attack in the capital city of San'a -- but unauthorized to speak on the record -- told CNN there was a ""clear and strong indication"" the U.S. embassy was targeted. ""My strong belief is that there is almost no doubt this is an effort directed at the U.S. embassy,"" the source said. The Yemeni government said the attack Tuesday -- which injured 13 students, three critically, at the Seventh of July school for girls, near the embassy -- could have stemmed from a personal dispute involving the school's headmistress. Yemen's ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab Abdulla al-Hajjri, said the attack was ""a private dispute."" ""The target was someone inside the school,"" al-Hajjri said. ""It had nothing to do with the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. Embassy was not a target."" However, CNN's source said the Yemeni government is calling this a private dispute to ""distract us"" from their security ""failure."" The source said Yemeni investigators are also looking at this as a terrorist attack and are ""energetically pursuing that line of thought. That reflects the seriousness in which they approach it."" The source indicated the Yemeni government ""does not have anyone in custody"" but ""they are looking for someone."" Yemeni soldiers guarding the embassy were hurt in the attack.

The pair will fight at Wembley Arena as Groves looks to win the belt and become WBC world title challenger . Reassuringly, he knows it. In the early part of the build up for this European super-middleweight title challenge to French holder Christopher Rebrasse, Groves talked - whimsically and almost certainly in vain - about a third tilt at world champion Froch despite two stoppages at the hands of the Nottingham Cobra. He also expanded on his writing of a sit-com and introduced the first recruits to his secondary boxing business as a now-licensed manager. But now he sounds fully focussed on what should be a routine job at hand, assuming there really are no distractions. Groves says ‘I’m back on track to win a world title and I’m aware I can’t afford another mistake.’ Groves (left) weighed in at 11st 13lb 6oz with Rebrasse (right) topping the scales at a heavier 11st 13lbs 8oz .

If any additional incentive were needed for him to rebound from that brutal knock-out inflicted by Froch in the Stadium just across the way from the Arena in which he fights Rebrasse, it comes with the WBC’s confirmation that the winner of this one will become the mandatory challenger for that organisation’s version of the world title.

7754c3d440ea738e631b4895adc96ac7c9984d96,"Blow: The poor result will come as an embarrassing blow to Chancellor George Osborne's Project Merlin agreement . Net lending by banks to cash-strapped businesses collapsed by nearly £10billion last year, figures revealed yesterday. The Bank of England statistics make a mockery of Project Merlin, the Government's attempt to encourage banks to boost credit for companies. The figures come as a survey by financial specialist Bibby Financial Services reveals the owners of small firms are resorting to drawing on personal savings to keep their businesses going. A separate survey of more than 11,000 members of the Federation of Small Businesses showed a third had used their own savings to fund their businesses. The Bank of England figures offer a devastating insight into how five of Britain's biggest banks – Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Barclays and Santander – behaved towards firms last year. The figures show that between January and December, net lending – the amount of money handed out by the banks minus the amount that was repaid – slumped by £9.6billion. This means banks received £9.6billion more in loan repayments than they paid out. Overall, the gross lending target to small firms was £76billion, but the five banks managed to hand out only £74.9billion. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'Small firms are still finding it too difficult to secure the finance they need.' Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, said the promises of Project Merlin 'were not worth the paper they were written on'. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat . peer who resigned over Project Merlin, said the lack of lending was 'a . knife in the back for growth and jobs'. Figures: The Bank of England's 2012 'Trends in Lending' data is not directly comparable with the Project Merlin figures, but shows that net lending to SMEs has actually been falling since 2008 .
